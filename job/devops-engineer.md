## Who is a DevOps engineer?

> Additional: [кто такой DevOps-инженер](https://tproger.ru/articles/devops-engineer/).

A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates.

Development teams and IT operations teams can have different skills and different goals. Developers want to introduce new features to an application, while operations teams want to preserve the stability of an application once it is released. 

DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management. All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its philosophy, practices, and tools. 

Maybe you want to shift your career to DevOps, or train yourself to drive adoption within your company. But how do you become a DevOps engineer?

## What does a DevOps engineer do?

Within an agile environment, developers, system administrators, and programmers can be siloed, working on the same product but not sharing information necessary to ensure value to the user. DevOps engineers reduce that complexity, closing the gap between actions needed to quickly change an application, and the tasks that maintain its reliability. 

Some organizations may hire professionals to "perform DevOps" within their workflows, but because successful DevOps adoption depends on changes to culture and process, this may just deepen the disconnect between developers and operational teams.

## DevOps essentials

DevOps engineers build new skills on top of their current experience. Tasks like data management and library updates for new product releases combine with needs for leadership and collaboration across teams. It is important for DevOps engineers to understand the fundamentals of application development and delivery.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**
You and your teams can build and test changes, add to repositories, and deploy updates quickly and efficiently.
[What is CI/CD?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd)

**Security**
DevOps processes can account for and address software vulnerabilities.

- [ ] OSI model.
- [ ] [SaltStack](https://www.saltstack.com/) — an open-source tool that uses the push-model to execute commands over SSH. It provides support for YAML templates and horizontal and vertical scaling.

**Infrastructure as Code**

According to the IaC model (Infrastructure as Code), the process of setting up infrastructure is similar to the software development process. You have to work with containerization, container orchestration, infrastructure provisioning and configuration management using specific tools.

**Cloud providers and design patterns for cloud environments**

So how can you become a DevOps engineer in 2021 without knowing about popular providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Heroku, Azure, Google Cloud and DigitalOcean?

As for Cloud Design Patterns, it's important to understand the challenges you face when developing cloud-based applications:

- Availability - the percentage of system uptime that can be affected by attacks, workloads, system errors and infrastructure issues.
- Data management is an important element of cloud applications. Data is often scattered across multiple servers, which gives better performance and availability, but can also cause a number of difficulties like synchronization.
- Design and implementation are decisions that involve agreement in creation and deployment, maintenance, administration, component and subsystem reuse.
- Management and monitoring are mandatory activities aimed at tracking and controlling the system provided that cloud applications are run remotely, where there is no complete control over the infrastructure.

**Extra**

- [ ] Work with proxy.
- [ ] Work with firewall.
- [ ] Various web servers.
- [ ] Load balancing.
- [ ] Caching.
- [ ] CI/CD and monitoring tools

All this is detailed in the roadmap.
