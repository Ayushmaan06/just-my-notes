Use Microsoft Word version. Alternative versions: graphic, plain text, braille, pdf, in any language other than English.

## Cover letter

- It should briefly introduce you and make a case for why you would be a strong candidate for a particular position.
- Don’t repeat all of your qualifications – your resume will contain the details. Just include enough information to show that you are well qualified and interest the reader enough      to schedule you for an interview.    

Greeting:

- open with a greeting and address the letter to a      specific person whenever possible
- no name? Address it to the title of the person you hope will see the letter, such as “Dear Hiring Manager”. Use correct business punctuation.    

> *Dear Ms. Ericson:*

First paragraph:

- State the title of the job to which you’re applying, and why you feel you might be a good fit.
- It’s also sometimes useful to mention where you saw the job listed or who referred you, and it can be very effective if you can express why you are enthusiastic about the company. 

>  *I was excited when my colleague Janna Navarro told me your company had an opening for a Data Analyst 2. I have admired the products developed by Torotoni Software for many years, and I would be very interested in joining your team. I am a data analyst with 3 years of professional experience and skills that match your needs, and I think I would be a strong candidate.*

Build a case for your strengths as a candidate:

- Cite a few examples from your experience that match the skills they mentioned in the job listing; draw parallels between the listing and your resume and portfolio.
- Quantify your experiences when possible. However, keep this brief and focused. Pick some best examples and keep some of your work to discuss further when you interview.

> *In my most recent role, I maintained and extended a mission-critical database and prepared a weekly report of changes and trends for stakeholders. I also worked with the coding and management teams to improve functionality of the database by 45%, advised on compliance issues, and supervised the work of 2 interns. I know SQL and Python, have intermediate proficiency in Hadoop and Apache Spark, and have used Tableau software for visualization.*

Close by restating your interest, say you hope to meet with them      further, and then add a polite signoff.

> *Thank you for your consideration. I would love to bring my skills to Torotoni Software, and I’m eager to discuss the contributions I can make to your team.*
>
> *Best regards,*
>
> *Olivia Torvald*

Use Microsoft Word for the format.



An example of an information list for a professional reference:

- Name
- Title
- Company
- Mailing address
- Phone number
- Email address

Most employers will prefer to talk to your supervisors as professional references, but you can also list:    

- Colleagues if they worked closely with you.
- Professors who are familiar with your classwork if you have a short work history.        
- People who have supervised or worked with you on a volunteer project.

Personal references aren't nessassary.

## Elevator Pitch

It’s a short, easily memorized statement that describes yourself, some of your key features as a job seeker, and your goals.

Rarely needed, but can be useful.  It can help you draft a cover      letter, speak easily to a potential hirer when you network at an event, answer general interview questions such as “tell us about yourself,” and so on. In an interview, it will help you seem poised and prepared.

Your elevator pitch should answer three questions:

- Who are you?

  Start by introducing yourself with your full name and add your preferred name if you have one. If you’re in a face-to-face situation, this is a good time to offer a handshake. Follow this with a statement about your career title and      current situation.    

- What do you do?

  Provide a few key pieces of skill or experience that set you apart and make you an interesting candidate. Don’t try to list your whole resume – pick a highlight or two about your recent experience. When you’ve decided on your points, arrange them in a way that makes sense; you want to tell a story, not just list bullet points. Making a story out of your points quickly engages your reader’s or listener’s interest.    

- What do you want?

  Finish with an action request. This could be asking for an interview, stating why you’re interested in a particular position, or even just asking whether your statement covers the question they were asking. The idea is to encourage the      other person to engage with you, not just listen to what you’ve said. This will definitely depend on the context and setting, so think of a few possible endings.    

> *“Hi, I’m Jonathan Bittmann. I’m a data scientist working toward a move into management. I’ve spent the last six years as a data analyst for a cloud development company, where I’ve developed my skills in programming and served as team leader. While leading several successful project teams, I became interested in data science management and have gone back to school to earn a business administration degree. While I’m working on that, I’m looking for a position in project management so I can put my learning to use. I’m very interested in the work your company does and I think I could bring a lot of expertise and leadership to your organization. Could we meet to discuss the open project manager roles you currently have?”*

While you’re composing your elevator pitch, use natural-sounding language and  avoid jargon. Use your own phrasing. 

After you write your pitch, work to memorize it. Practice your pitch until you are comfortable and can easily deliver it verbally. Slow down and speak clearly. Being nervous will likely make you speak more quickly, so practice slowing down and enunciating.

It will make sense to tailor it to the context you’re in.

# Applying and Preparing to interview

Features of resume and cover letter stand out when managers are looking for good dve candidates?

- write cover letter after researching about the company, the hiring manager, the position
- make a strong case fir why you are a good fit
- convey your passion for the possition
- keep the resume short
- cover your school stuff, cover your prof. experience, your skills, techs and languages you're interested in.

Build a network of contacts:

- on Twitter, who are interested in the field. Interact with them
- Join online communities like StackOverflow & Discord. Meetups
- LinkedIn
- provide help to people junior to you

Good job listing:

- not a laundry list of skills
- capture the spirit of candidates
- short list of skills they need to have
- it tells about the experience and opportunities for growth the company can offer

### Company and Industry Research for Full Stack Dev

- Learn as much as possible about the company
- websites: History, Keywords, Careers, Presentation
- check Chamber of Commerce and Better Bussiness Bureae, social media accounts, web search, LinkedIn (ample company information), Glassdoor (experience with the company)

Plan an info interview:

- find someone to interview
- allow conversation to flow naturally, be open and take notes, keep track of time- ask questions: how did you become interested in full stack dev role? How did you prepare to enter the field? How did you begin your career? What is a typical day? What you like most? Difficult challenges? Issues and trends? How do you stay current?

### Networking online and offline

- Network is essential. 
- Professional net sites: Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or Monster, FlexJobs, Shine. Most of them use ATS software.
- Keep LinkedIn profile updated. Make sure all experience and skills are listed. Flag profile as available for work. Use features like skill tests and testimonials
- research people as well as companies.
- follow social media accounts
- attend events

### Assessing job listings

Most job listings are divided into sev. sections:

- overview of the company and the role
- responsibilities and tasks
- req. and qualifications (some will be listed as required and others preferred or optional)

Full-time (FTE) vs contract roles (contingent or temporary)

- this refers to tax status of the worker, not their working hours (many contractors work full-time hours)
- FTE employees and contact eployees often don't have the same terms of employment- both have their benefits and drawbacks

FTE:

- work can be expected to continue indefinitely
- pay may be more regular
- must comply with internal policies (trainings and work procedures)
- is entitled to recieve company benefits and incentives
- usually has different legal rights regarding firing and labor practices (may be not true in some states)

Contract roles:

- works for specified length of time
- payment for services by hourly pay or by deliverables
- recieves minimal training (they are expected to begin work with needed skills)
- does not receive company benefits or incentives
- may not be covered by certain workplace protections

Warning flags in listings:

- lack of clarity in job title, role, or description
- unnecessary jargon
- unrealistic expectations (company does not understand the position)
- evident bias or prejudice (personal traits: gender, race, nationality, etc.)

### Applications

One approach would be to apply first for the position you believe you are most qualified for or that interests you most. After applying, contact human resources (HR) or a hiring manager to ask for advice about whether you should apply for each job you are interested in or if it’s best to avoid duplicate application submissions. They should be able to tell you whether your application can be forwarded or whether the company allows you to create a profile that lets you easily apply for multiple jobs.

#### Common Errors

Resume – Double-check for these potential problems and any others you may spot:

-  Outdated or missing contact information

-  Grammatical and formatting errors

-  Using an unprofessional email address

-  Cliche vocabulary or jargon

- Unrelated job experience or irrelevant hobbies

- Attaching a photo of yourself (your resume should not contain a photo)

Cover letter – Be careful to check for these issues:

- Grammatical and formatting errors

- Too long (multiple pages) or too brief

- Addressing the wrong person or misspelling a name

- Not tailoring the letter to the specific company and job opening

- Tone is arrogant or too humble—try for a professional, confident tone

- Listing references in the letter

- Explaining the reason(s) why you are no longer working for your previous employer or including other issues that will be better to discuss in an interview if necessary



List of references – Look out for some common mistakes applicants make with their lists:

- Providing it too early (if it is not requested, save it for later in the screening process)
- Failing to notify your references that they may be contacted by hiring employers
- Providing incorrect contact information

Letters of recommendation – Avoid presenting a letter with the following errors:

- Too vague or generic content
- Lacking information that validates your work
- Any letter that expresses reservations, especially if it is not counterbalanced with mentioning any positive qualities

School/college transcripts – Do not provide a copy of your transcripts if the hiring company has stated that you must request a sealed copy be sent directly to them by the educational institution.

Online portfolio’s URL – Verify that the URL is correct and that the link is valid and provides work samples that are recent and properly documented.

Work or writing samples – Check for these common errors:

- Grammatical errors
- Does not show your work effectively
- Cliches or overuse of buzzwords
- Too brief or too lengthy

Certifications (trainings, licenses, and others) – Verify these features:

- Valid signatures, seals, or logos are present
- If the certificate includes an expiration date, make sure it is still current
- Only include relevant certificates that support your academic or experiential qualifications for the job position

Make sure that you have used a consistent naming convention for your files. Include your full name as part of the file names. For example, if your resume is contained in an electronic file with the name “John_Smith-Resume.pdf,” then name the rest of your supporting documents “John_Smith-Cover_Letter.pdf.” 

Limit your special characters to underscores and/or hyphens.

It may be convenient to create a template for your cover letters. Include your name, job title, and contact information. Use a cover letter you have already written and identify the customized information.

### Interview Rehearsal

Elavator pitch is a brief intro of yourself and your goals. 3-4 sentences:

- name and title "My name is Vlad Beklenyshchev and I'm a data scientist."
- recent experience "For the past two year I've worked in an entry-level role helping derive business insights from data using established models at an e-commerce company"
- goal  "I would eventually like to move into designing machine learning models and I'm looking for a mid-level position with opportunities to work toward that goal."

Prepare answers:

- Why did you choose this field, and why are you interested in this job
- Tell us about a time you solved a problem on a project and how you did it.
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

Ask your own questions:

- Use your notes from researching the company: ask about the product, the company structure, recent news releases, and so on.
- Remember that you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you
- Practice asking questions aload


Read notes, paraphprase, watch yourself, record yourself and review.

Enlist a friend to help you practice.

- be true to yourself

What are you looking for when you ask a beh. q., and that can be different at dif. times?

- clarify a hunch, like if a candidate is not a team player
- clarify if I have a wroing impression about a candidate
- tailor the questions to know the candidate better
- ask q specific to a behavioural issue that is a cause of worry.

Case study questions:

- useful to determine candidate's mindset and reasoning ability

- don't offer a salary figure at the outset
- do not undervalue yourself
- research the salary range for the job position
- request an offer higher than the min you would accept

### Overview of the Interview Process

First-round screens, technical screens:

- code challenges
- technical test

Second-round screens:

- team interviews
- human resources screens
- technical interviews

Final interview:

- meet higher-level managers
- talk in more depth and detail about the role
- answer more situational and beh. qs
- have a last chance to ask any questions

### Coding Challenges in Software Development

coding challenge or take-home questions: usually after the 1st screening phase, although it's sometimes the 1st step.

full-stack assessments assess both front-end and back-end dev. capabilities

Each comany will test according to its own tech stack:

- Ex. "Full Stack Python Dev" Django+MySQL or Flask+PostgreSQL
- Sometimes a coding challenge is directed, and reqs are clearly stated
- For more exp. positions, the problem is explained, but no expactation is given about how it will be achieved
- Newer devs may want to add a lot of features to create impressive results. Keep scope narrow, but finish all reqs fully. ONE THING WELL > many things incompletely

Take-home quiz completed in shorter time (~40 minutes). A coding challenge will have a firm deadline, but you'll be given a more time to comlete it (sev hours - a few days)

Sample code q:

- problem statement: Build a pseudo web app to list all the service providers to explore them
  - use a web api to fech data
  - data set parameters: {name, lowest price ...}
  - manage and host this app on free cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, or OpenShift)
  - visually interactive, responsive desing
  - add a feature to sort this list of ISPs by location/price/speed
  - implement search (by name, price, or rating)

- Bonus: add a feature to download a pdf file or ISP details

This challenge has a time limit of 12 hours. Submit source code and screenshots along with any notes or explanation by zipping the files and submitting them to the provided upload option. 

Code will be evaluated by devs and the interview team. Evaulation criteria:

- functionality of the app
- design aesthetics
- code quality

### Second-round screens

Second-round interviews are usually more focused than first or final interviews. You may meet with the same interviewers, but you will more likely meet with team leaders, technical managers, HR personnel, or others with distinct areas of interest. You may meet with higher-level or executive management, but each company proceeds differently. 

#### HR Screen

 A screen by a human resources (HR) professional will usually focus on very basic qs about your past experience and understanding of the company and its culture. It may even take place as a first interview. It generally won’t get into the nuts and bolts of a position, and there won’t be involved technical qs. 

Here are some qs you might expect from this screen:

- What motivated you to apply for this job?
- What attracted you to our job listing?
- Why did you leave your last job?
- What is your ideal working environment?
- What do you know about our company’s product or services?
- What are your expectations about salary and other compensation?

#### Team Leader

 If you interview with a team leader (often a project manager or other management), they may want to discuss the team you’d be working with and how they approach projects. 

There may be some discussion of your skills, but less than you would do with a technical screen. The team leader will be interested in understanding your work style, so they may ask you more behavioral questions. 

Here are some examples of questions you might expect:

- Tell me about a few of the first things you would do in this role.
- Give a few examples of best practices in data science.
- What’s a data science project you would want to work on at our company?
- Tell me about a time you experienced conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it.
- Tell me about a time when your project failed. What did you do and what did you learn?
- Do you prefer to work closely with a team or mostly by yourself?
- How are you motivated?
- How do you start learning about a topic you don’t know about yet?

Project yourself as an already-hired team member and discuss specific things that you'd want to learn and accomplish. Focus your responses on how you want to grow as a professional while exceling in your new role within the company.

Interviewers sometimes ask questions, such as, “If you could have a superpower, which would it be and why?” Although it may initially seem as off-topic or unrelated to the job position, the way you respond to these questions may reveal how you handle the unexpected stress, or perhaps gauge your creativity or the way you approach problems. Answer honestly and have fun when you think about and answer these kinds of questions.

#### Technical Screen

A technical screen is usually conducted by a coding team leader or higher-level developer. Its purpose is to assess your technical skills and compare them to the skills needed for the position. Most of the questions will be about technical topics and team skills. 

Here are examples of the type of questions you may hear:

- What coding languages do you know?
- What are some of your favorite tools?
- How do you begin working on a problem you’ve been assigned?
- What do you do when you reach something you don’t understand?
- How do you stay on schedule and manage your time?
- How do you prepare for a presentation?

There will usually be some specific problems to solve as well. Don’t worry – the interviewer won’t expect you to provide a perfect solution at once. These questions are meant to understand how you approach a problem and your thinking strategies. 


No matter how you think the second interview goes, always try to end on a positive note and be explicit about your interest in the role.


### Final Interviewing

before:

- read your resume and cover letter
- review the job description
- study other notes
- rehearse your el. pitch
- plan appropriate appearance

interview q:

- related tech qs
- beh qs
- sit qs
- tech prob-solving qs

The STAR method helps you give substantial answers to situational qs:

- expains how you handle specific work challenges in a simple yet powerful way
- stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result
- Situation: the project or challenge you faced
- Task: your responsibility in the situation
- Action: the steps or procedure you followed to solve the problem
- Result: what happened after you acted

**Using the STAR method**

Q: Can you tell us about the most recent project you worked on?

- Situation: I was on a team that was tasked with moving a database to a new server
- Task: I was in charge of increasing the query speed of the new deployment.
- Action: I employed a data optimizer, made sure the indexes were improved, and updated the software.
- Result: This brought a 40% increase in query response time.

Behaviroral qs:

- with these qs, the int. wants to find out how you would respond to certain workplace challenges that may arise.
- Q: What would you if you were asked to perform a task and weren't sure how to complete it?
- Q: Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond your expected tasks while working on a project.
- ask for more information if needed

Questions for the interviewer:

- What's the next step in the interview/hiring process?
- How long does your recruitment process usually take?
- What are the primary responsibilities of the position?
- What would my day-to-day routine look like if I got the job?
- What can you tell me about the job apart from what was in the description?

Questions to avoid:

- how many holidays do you offer?
- do you have long working hours?

### After the interview

If you received an offer and the salary or employee benefits do not match what you consider is fair, research the market, bring forth your selling points, and express the valid reasons why you are requesting a higher salary. It is totally acceptable to request a fair compensation package. When you consider whether your compensation is fair, however, make sure to weigh in the value of the employee benefits package. Consider signing bonuses, moving allowances, stock options, and other non-salary compensation that’s offered, as well as less quantitative benefits like a better commute or flexible work times. 

The thought of negotiating a job salary offer may make you uncomfortable, but if the offer is below what you expected after factoring in all of the other considerations, you might want to negotiate a fairer salary. You might respond by phone or in email. Begin your response by expressing your excitement and appreciation for being selected. Include points on how you plan to contribute to achieving the company’s goals. Base your counteroffer on verifiable research or supporting arguments that there is a higher value to what you bring to the table. 

Some legitimate arguments to support a salary negotiation are:

- Commute (доїзд) and relocation (переїзд) expenses (витрати).
- Having a university degree that may have not been required to apply, but provides an academic preparation that will contribute to exceeding job performance expectations.
- Possessing a skillset or certifications that required extensive or costly training, especially if they were stated as preferred qualifications in the job listing.

However, the company responds, make sure you express appreciation for their allowing you to approach them with your request. The company may not be able to accommodate your request because of budget or company policies about standard pay scales for certain positions, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

If you are between interview rounds or awaiting an offer from another company, you must contact them and let them know you wish to withdraw your application for their position. Let them know you appreciate their consideration but have decided to accept another offer. Always ask them to keep your information in case other opportunities arise in the future and treat them professionally and courteously – you never know when you’ll be in the job market again and want to contact them about another position, so maintain a good reputation.

If you must resign from a current job, you should provide your employer a standard two weeks’ notice whenever possible. Again, always behave professionally and maintain your good reputation, in case you need a reference someday or even return for a different job. Try to arrange a start date with your new employer so that you are able to take some time off between jobs. Reporting to your first day at the new job after a few days of rest will help ease your transition and onboarding process, as opposed to jumping right in the day after you left your previous workplace. 

### If you are declined

 Contact your interviewers by phone or email and let them know that you appreciate the notification. After all, many companies nowadays don’t make an effort to contact the job applicants who weren’t selected for an opening. Request feedback! Ask for an honest assessment and keep an open mind, especially if any points in their feedback are unexpected. Maybe the points you overlooked played a big part in not being selected for the position. Also, you may want to ask for advice on what you should work on to improve. Be aware, though, that many companies prohibit their personnel from giving feedback about interviews (often for legal reasons), so you may not be able to get more information.


Q: Why might a company ask you to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before working on a coding challenge? 

A: To keep you from sharing the problems with other applicants and to establish who owns the work you do on the challenge.

> Correct. NDAs keep things clear and legal, protecting the company and the applicant.
