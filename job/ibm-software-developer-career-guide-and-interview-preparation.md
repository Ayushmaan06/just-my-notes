## Cover letter

- It should briefly introduce you and make a case for why you would be a strong candidate for a particular position.
- Don’t repeat all of your qualifications – your resume will contain the details. Just include enough information to show that you are well qualified and interest the reader enough      to schedule you for an interview.    

Greeting:

- open with a greeting and address the letter to a      specific person whenever possible
- no name? Address it to the title of the person you hope will see the letter, such as “Dear Hiring Manager”. Use correct business punctuation.    

> *Dear Ms. Ericson:*

First paragraph:

- State the title of the job to which you’re applying, and why you feel you might be a good fit.
- It’s also sometimes useful to mention where you saw the job listed or who referred you, and it can be very effective if you can express why you are enthusiastic about the company. 

>  *I was excited when my colleague Janna Navarro told me your company had an opening for a Data Analyst 2. I have admired the products developed by Torotoni Software for many years, and I would be very interested in joining your team. I am a data analyst with 3 years of professional experience and skills that match your needs, and I think I would be a strong candidate.*

Build a case for your strengths as a candidate:

- Cite a few examples from your experience that match the skills they mentioned in the job listing; draw parallels between the listing and your resume and portfolio.
- Quantify your experiences when possible. However, keep this brief and focused. Pick some best examples and keep some of your work to discuss further when you interview.

> *In my most recent role, I maintained and extended a mission-critical database and prepared a weekly report of changes and trends for stakeholders. I also worked with the coding and management teams to improve functionality of the database by 45%, advised on compliance issues, and supervised the work of 2 interns. I know SQL and Python, have intermediate proficiency in Hadoop and Apache Spark, and have used Tableau software for visualization.*

Close by restating your interest, say you hope to meet with them      further, and then add a polite signoff.

> *Thank you for your consideration. I would love to bring my skills to Torotoni Software, and I’m eager to discuss the contributions I can make to your team.*
>
> *Best regards,*
>
> *Olivia Torvald*

Use Microsoft Word for the format.



An example of an information list for a professional reference:

- Name
- Title
- Company
- Mailing address
- Phone number
- Email address

Most employers will prefer to talk to your supervisors as professional references, but you can also list:    

- Colleagues if they worked closely with you.
- Professors who are familiar with your classwork if you have a short work history.        
- People who have supervised or worked with you on a volunteer project.

Personal references aren't nessassary.

## Elevator Pitch

It’s a short, easily memorized statement that describes yourself, some of your key features as a job seeker, and your goals.

Rarely needed, but can be useful.  It can help you draft a cover      letter, speak easily to a potential hirer when you network at an event, answer general interview questions such as “tell us about yourself,” and so on. In an interview, it will help you seem poised and prepared.

Your elevator pitch should answer three questions:

- Who are you?

  Start by introducing yourself with your full name and add your preferred name if you have one. If you’re in a face-to-face situation, this is a good time to offer a handshake. Follow this with a statement about your career title and      current situation.    

- What do you do?

  Provide a few key pieces of skill or experience that set you apart and make you an interesting candidate. Don’t try to list your whole resume – pick a highlight or two about your recent experience. When you’ve decided on your points, arrange them in a way that makes sense; you want to tell a story, not just list bullet points. Making a story out of your points quickly engages your reader’s or listener’s interest.    

- What do you want?

  Finish with an action request. This could be asking for an interview, stating why you’re interested in a particular position, or even just asking whether your statement covers the question they were asking. The idea is to encourage the      other person to engage with you, not just listen to what you’ve said. This will definitely depend on the context and setting, so think of a few possible endings.    

> *“Hi, I’m Jonathan Bittmann. I’m a data scientist working toward a move into management. I’ve spent the last six years as a data analyst for a cloud development company, where I’ve developed my skills in programming and served as team leader. While leading several successful project teams, I became interested in data science management and have gone back to school to earn a business administration degree. While I’m working on that, I’m looking for a position in project management so I can put my learning to use. I’m very interested in the work your company does and I think I could bring a lot of expertise and leadership to your organization. Could we meet to discuss the open project manager roles you currently have?”*

While you’re composing your elevator pitch, use natural-sounding language and  avoid jargon. Use your own phrasing. 

After you write your pitch, work to memorize it. Practice your pitch until you are comfortable and can easily deliver it verbally. Slow down and speak clearly. Being nervous will likely make you speak more quickly, so practice slowing down and enunciating.

It will make sense to tailor it to the context you’re in.

### Company and Industry Research for Full Stack Dev

- Learn as much as possible about the company
- websites: History, Keywords, Careers, Presentation

- allow conversation to flow naturally, be open and take notes, keep track of time- ask questions: how did you become interested in full stack dev role? How did you prepare to enter the field? How did you begin your career? What is a typical day? What you like most? Difficult challenges? Issues and trends? How do you stay current?

### Networking online and offline

### Assessing job listings

Most job listings are divided into sev. sections:

- overview of the company and the role
- responsibilities and tasks
- req. and qualifications (some will be listed as required and others preferred or optional)

Full-time (FTE) vs contract roles (contingent or temporary)

- this refers to tax status of the worker, not their working hours (many contractors work full-time hours)
- FTE employees and contact eployees often don't have the same terms of employment- both have their benefits and drawbacks

FTE:

- work can be expected to continue indefinitely
- pay may be more regular
- must comply with internal policies (trainings and work procedures)
- is entitled to recieve company benefits and incentives
- usually has different legal rights regarding firing and labor practices (may be not true in some states)

Contract roles:

- works for specified length of time
- payment for services by hourly pay or by deliverables
- recieves minimal training (they are expected to begin work with needed skills)
- does not receive company benefits or incentives
- may not be covered by certain workplace protections

Warning flags in listings:

- lack of clarity in job title, role, or description
- unnecessary jargon
- unrealistic expectations (company does not understand the position)
- evident bias or prejudice (personal traits: gender, race, nationality, etc.)

### Applications

One approach would be to apply first for the position you believe you are most qualified for or that interests you most. After applying, contact human resources (HR) or a hiring manager to ask for advice about whether you should apply for each job you are interested in or if it’s best to avoid duplicate application submissions. They should be able to tell you whether your application can be forwarded or whether the company allows you to create a profile that lets you easily apply for multiple jobs.

#### Common Errors

Resume – Double-check for these potential problems and any others you may spot:

-  Outdated or missing contact information

-  Grammatical and formatting errors

-  Using an unprofessional email address

-  Cliche vocabulary or jargon

- Unrelated job experience or irrelevant hobbies

- Attaching a photo of yourself (your resume should not contain a photo)

Cover letter – Be careful to check for these issues:

- Grammatical and formatting errors

- Too long (multiple pages) or too brief

- Addressing the wrong person or misspelling a name

- Not tailoring the letter to the specific company and job opening

- Tone is arrogant or too humble—try for a professional, confident tone

- Listing references in the letter

- Explaining the reason(s) why you are no longer working for your previous employer or including other issues that will be better to discuss in an interview if necessary



List of references – Look out for some common mistakes applicants make with their lists:

- Providing it too early (if it is not requested, save it for later in the screening process)
- Failing to notify your references that they may be contacted by hiring employers
- Providing incorrect contact information

Letters of recommendation – Avoid presenting a letter with the following errors:

- Too vague or generic content
- Lacking information that validates your work
- Any letter that expresses reservations, especially if it is not counterbalanced with mentioning any positive qualities

School/college transcripts – Do not provide a copy of your transcripts if the hiring company has stated that you must request a sealed copy be sent directly to them by the educational institution.

Online portfolio’s URL – Verify that the URL is correct and that the link is valid and provides work samples that are recent and properly documented.

Work or writing samples – Check for these common errors:

- Grammatical errors
- Does not show your work effectively
- Cliches or overuse of buzzwords

Certifications (trainings, licenses, and others) – Verify these features:

- Valid signatures, seals, or logos are present
- If the certificate includes an expiration date, make sure it is still current
- Only include relevant certificates that support your academic or experiential qualifications for the job position

Make sure that you have used a consistent naming convention for your files. Include your full name as part of the file names. For example, if your resume is contained in an electronic file with the name “John_Smith-Resume.pdf,” then name the rest of your supporting documents “John_Smith-Cover_Letter.pdf.” 

Limit your special characters to underscores and/or hyphens.

It may be convenient to create a template for your cover letters. Include your name, job title, and contact information. Use a cover letter you have already written and identify the customized information.

### Interview Rehearsal

Elavator pitch is a brief intro of yourself and your goals. 3-4 sentences:

- name and title "My name is Vlad Beklenyshchev and I'm a data scientist."
- recent experience "For the past two year I've worked in an entry-level role helping derive business insights from data using established models at an e-commerce company"
- goal  "I would eventually like to move into designing machine learning models and I'm looking for a mid-level position with opportunities to work toward that goal."

Prepare answers:

- Why did you choose this field, and why are you interested in this job
- Tell us about a time you solved a problem on a project and how you did it.
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

Ask your own questions:

- Use your notes from researching the company: ask about the product, the company structure, recent news releases, and so on.
