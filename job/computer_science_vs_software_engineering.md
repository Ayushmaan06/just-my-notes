# Computer Science VS Software Engineering

## Computer Science WIKI

> H. Abelson: "Computer Science is not really about computers.".

### Wiki interpretation

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.

It is the scientific and practical *approach* to computation and its applications *and* the *systematic study* of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithm) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

> Systemic describes something that happens or exists throughout a whole system. E.g. infection.
> Systematic describes something that was thorough and intentional, methodical, or implemented according to a plan. E.g.

An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. *A computer scientist* specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.

### Computer Science and programming

Most of computer science has very little to do with programming - it has to do with computational models, the mathematical basis of computing, technology & hardware architectures, system software (operating systems, compilers), major software technologies & components (e.g., different kinds of databases), programming paradigms, the design of computer languages, developing classes of algorithms & heuristics, etc.

> Programming is about driving a car, Computer Science is about whatâ€™s under the hood.

## Software Engineering

Software Engineering - sometimes lumped in with Computer Science, but more accurately an engineering discipline that builds on Computer Science - focuses more on the structure of software systems (architecture, data flows, control flows, major technologies & components, program structure, engineering methods) than on writing code.

### Software Engineering and Programming

Yes, ultimately, one uses computers by writing programs. And one learns some programming skills when studying Computer Science or Software Engineering (but less than one might expect).

> Software Engineers write code really rarely but Software Developers do it a lot. Software Development is a sub-discipline of Software Engineering.
