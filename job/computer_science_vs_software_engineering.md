# Computer Science VS Software Engineering

## Computer Science WIKI

> H. Abelson: "Computer Science is not really about computers.".

### Wiki interpretation

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.

It is the scientific and practical *approach* to computation and its applications *and* the *systematic study* of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithm) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

> Systemic describes something that happens or exists throughout a whole system. E.g. infection.
> Systematic describes something that was thorough and intentional, methodical, or implemented according to a plan. E.g.

An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. *A computer scientist* specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.

### Computer Science and programming

If you've taken a CS class before then you know how much math is actually involved. You have to make sure that the algorithm you're designing doesn't increase the Big O to some ridiculous number and to do that, at the bare minimum you need to know some algebra 2.

This is where most of the complex machine learning algorithms come from and believe me, they take way more math knowledge than just algebra. When's the last time you really had to do complex math in web development? It's extremely rare that a web developer will ever have to deal with Bayesian statistics.

Take this with a grain of salt because there is way more to computer science than just math. You have to create the architecture for your programs and that could be dependent on the hardware you're using.

A computer scientist might never touch a piece of code if their algorithms and architectures get passed on to a developer. Most computer scientists know how to write code, but there is a large chunk that aren't very good at it.

Again, most of computer science has very little to do with programming - it has to do with computational models, the mathematical basis of computing, technology & hardware architectures, system software (operating systems, compilers), major software technologies & components (e.g., different kinds of databases), programming paradigms, the design of computer languages, developing classes of algorithms & heuristics, etc.

## Software Engineering

Software Engineering - sometimes lumped in with Computer Science, but more accurately an engineering discipline that builds on Computer Science - focuses more on the structure of software systems (architecture, data flows, control flows, major technologies & components, program structure, engineering methods) than on writing code.

### Software Engineering and Programming

Yes, ultimately, one uses computers by writing programs. And one learns some programming skills when studying Computer Science or Software Engineering (but less than one might expect).

> Software Engineers write code really rarely but Software Developers do it a lot. Software Development is a sub-discipline of Software Engineering.

## What you should choose. A quick overview of these two majors (CS and SE)

Computer Science is the study of how computers work, mostly from the theoretical and mathematical perspective.
You should choose Computer Science if you like math, logic, or if you want to get into a specialized field in CS such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, security, or graphics.

Software Engineering is the study of how software systems are built, including topics such as project management, quality assurance, and software testing.
You should choose Software Engineering if you are more interested in the hands-on approach, and if you want to learn the overall life cycle of how software is built and maintained.

Both Computer Science and Software Engineering teach fundamentals of programming and computer science, so you can choose either one to become a software developer.

### Job prospects

The most common job graduates get after earning their Computer Science or Software Engineering degree is Software Developer or Software Engineer.

There are other related options as well, such as Product Manager, QA Analyst, and Technology Consultant. Your options will depend on your specific skill set.

### Knowledge requirements

When it comes to the requirements in math and statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering are almost identical. They cover combinatorics, probability and statistics.

The core computer science requirements are similar as well, ranging over algorithms, data structures, and operating systems.

The key difference are that:

- Software Engineering has more requirements in electrical engineering and software engineering fundamentals, such as software testing, design, and software requirements specification.
- Computer Science allows more electives in higher-level computer science courses. You can choose from a wide range of topics such as security, software engineering fundamentals, computer vision, machine learning, and database management.

### So, which major should you choose?

I think it mostly depends on your preferences. In short:

- You should choose Computer Science if you like math, logic, or if you want to get into a specialized field in CS such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, security or graphics.
- You should choose Software Engineering if you’re more interested in the hands-on approach, and if you want to learn the overall life cycle of how software is built and maintained.

## What is the difference between Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering?

The three programs have common elements:  they all stress an understanding of both digital hardware and software, though to varying degrees, and they all hone students' problem-solving skills. However, the programs have different objectives [3].

- Computer Engineering (CE) deals with designing, developing, and operating computer systems.  At its core, Computer Engineering concentrates on digital hardware devices and computers, and the software that controls them.  Advanced courses focus on standard designs and techniques for specific application domains. In contrast to CS and SE, Computer Engineering emphasizes solving problems in digital hardware and at the hardware-software interface.
- Computer Science (CS) focuses on understanding, designing, and developing programs and computers. At its core, Computer Science concentrates on data, data transformation, and algorithms. Advanced courses present specialized programming techniques and specific application domains. The CS program is less structured than the CE and SE programs, giving students more flexibility to build depth or breadth in a variety of application domains or in the fundamentals of Computer Science.
- Software Engineering (SE) deals with building and maintaining software systems. It is more software-oriented and has a greater emphasis on large software applications than Computer Engineering. It is more applied than Computer Science, placing greater emphasis on the entire software development process, from idea to final product.  It is also more disciplined than Computer Science, applying more systematic practices to help ensure that products are reliable and safe.
