### What's the Difference Between Copywriters and Journalists?

Copywriters typically work in advertising and marketing campaigns for a wide range of businesses and organizations. Journalists, on the other hand, report on news and feature stories across several potential forms of media.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a bachelor's degree is typically needed to work as a copywriter.
