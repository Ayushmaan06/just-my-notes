*Software engineering* is a detailed study of engineering to the design development, and maintenance of software.

*Software development* is directly linked to the practice of coding to develop, test and deliver software solutions.

## Who is a software development engineer?

The software development engineer (or software engineer) can be thought of as the enabler of software development.

Software engineers are involved in numerous aspects of software development, from system architecting, design, modeling, DevOps, testing, deployment, maintenance, user support and more. They enforce engineering concepts and methodologies to develop processes and architect systems.

Typically, the software development engineer creates instructions that are then handed down to software developers/programmers to code. Also, software engineers may operate with different software from vendors, like Microsoft Office, SAS, ERP, and other ready-to-use software. While written as a simple statement, creating detailed instructions for programmers is a labor-intensive activity for software engineers that involves algorithms, diagrams, data structures, statistics, flow charts, design blueprints, and more.

## Who is a software developer?

The software developer is a professional who takes care of the coding side of developing software. 

In essence, the software developer (programmer) is thought of as the individual who gathers requirements and writes the necessary code to create a software application or system. Software developers are generalists who are capable of working with different programming languages and platforms. 

## Software developer vs software engineer goals

The main difference between a software developer and a software engineer is in terms of the goals they are set out to achieve. 

A software engineer covers a wider spectrum of skills and responsibilities inherent to the job title. With a wide range of software engineering tasks to create software, software engineers use *system principles* to get the job done. Typically, software engineers participate in the software development life cycle by linking client needs with technology solutions.

On the other hand, software developers work deeply at the core level of computer programs. Software developers write, test and execute and are responsible for the coding facet in the software development lifecycle.

Some of the differences between software engineer vs software developer include the following:
- The software engineer architects [software components](https://simplicable.com/new/software-components) to build a system while programmers create the code needed to complete a program.
- The software engineer works as part of an assembled team of specialists who design and architect large software systems in a systematic fashion while programmers have more freedom to perform activities via different methods and practices, differing from one programmer to the next.
- Software engineers usually instruct programmers on what the system program must be. Programmers are solely dedicated to translating those instructions into code needed for the software to run.

## Skills of a software engineer

A software engineer must be well-versed and excel at both analytic and numerical skills, on top of conceptual problem-solving skills. This well-rounded professional is usually required to hold at least a masters degree in an engineering field to complement their portfolio of skills. Here, we take a look at some of the key technical knowledge areas and skills software engineers should possess to be successful:

## Common background: computer science, mathematics and software engineering

While both roles produce and focus on relatively different aspects of software solutions, they do share a common background. Most software engineers and developers hold bachelor’s degrees in computer science, information systems, information technology, or engineering with an emphasis on software systems.

Along with the common background the roles of both software engineers and software developers have in terms of education, they also share knowledge and skills in these areas: computer science, information systems, mathematics and software engineering.

- **Computer science**: This term often partially overlaps with software engineering, but in reality, it fulfills a different role. It is recommended that both software engineers and software developers are proficient in computer science as it deals with discovering, testing, and researching new ways to get things done in the realm of software development. Computer science learns about data by computer architecture, using algorithms, placing its greatest emphasis on data and the most effective ways to process, interpret, store, communicate and secure saved.

- **Mathematics**: The importance of mathematics for both software engineers and software developers cannot be stressed enough. Both roles rely heavily on the use of mathematical methods to understand, design, and create software that is accurate, precise, and effective. Mathematics plays a fundamental role in algorithms, statistics, modeling, analytics, data interpretation, data science and more,  which are all important to both these roles as they aim to deliver valuable software solutions that are backed by pure, perfect mathematics.

- **Software engineering**: The use of systematic approaches to develop software, including software production, software development, and software maintenance is fundamental to both roles of software engineering and software development. Software engineering provides the scientific backdrop to create successful software projects that are thoroughly researched and designed.

## To conclude

A job description for a software engineering role should focus on key operational aspects of understanding and applying core scientific and practical methods of developing software. These professionals should be advocates for analytical thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, strong programming, and coding knowledge, to the manner born project manager, overall understanding of different programming languages, and more.

A job description for a software developer role should emphasize the importance of the coding facet within the software development life cycle. As mentioned previously, an all-inclusive software developer must be skilled and experienced in coding structures and programming languages to thrive.

To put it in the simplest terms: software engineers architect and oversee the entire process of creating and supporting software while software developers are usually in charge of the coding dimension of building software. For software developers, coding and programming is a sufficiently large task in itself without dealing with the complexities of the entire scope of the software development lifecycle using scientific methods to architect a software system. So, I don't think that software engineers really should code too much.
