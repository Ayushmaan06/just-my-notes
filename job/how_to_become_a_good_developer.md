### Graphics Developer

This is a type of developer specialized in writing software for rendering, lighting, shadowing, shading, culling, and management of scenes. These developers are often responsible for integrating technologies in the gaming and video production industry.

Skills: frameworks include DirectX, OpenGL, Unity 3D, WebGL. For more advanced graphic developers, low-level development requires C, C++, and Assembly.

### Game Developer

This is a generic term to identify a developer specialized in writing games. Game developers can fall into one of the other categories of developers, but they often have specific knowledge and skills in designing and implementing engaging and interactive gaming experiences.

Skills: Frameworks used by game developers include DirectX, OpenGL, Unity 3D, WebGL, and languages such as C, C++, and Java. Since Flash is being abandoned, JavaScript and HTML5 became the new standard. On mobile devices, Swift and Java are now the technologies of choice for iOS and Android games.

### Data Scientist

This type of developer writes software programs to analyze data sets. Data scientists need to mine through and manipulate loads of data using analytical approaches. Think crunching large data sets, potentially using some cluster-computing approach, and developing a scientific application based on the findings of your data. They are often in charge of statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Skills: Languages used by data scientists often include SQL, MatLab, R, and Python. Frameworks are next: TensorFlow, Caffe, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit/CNTK,  Torch/PyTorch.

### Big Data Developer / DataBase Engineer (or Data Platform engineer)

This type of developer writes software programs to store and retrieve vast amounts of data in systems such as data warehouses, ETL (Extract Transform Load) systems, relational databases, data lakes management systems, etc.

Skills: A big data developer is often familiar with frameworks and systems for distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark. Languages used by Big Data Developers include SQL, Java, Python, and R.

Skills: technologies used by these developers include SAP, Salesforce, Sharepoint, and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).

### Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) / Quality Assurance

This type of developer is responsible for writing software to validate the quality of software systems. They create automated tests, tools and systems to make sure that products and processes run as expected. Often QA Engineers does manual testing and document writing.

Skills: technologies used by SDETs include Python, Ruby, and Selenium.

### Embedded Developer

> Embedded developers are often low-level developers, but not always.

These developers work with hardware that isn’t commonly classified as computers. For example, microcontrollers, real-time systems, electronic interfaces, set-top boxes, consumer devices, iOT devices, hardware drivers, and serial data transmission fall into this category. 

Skills: languages such as C, C++, Assembly, Java or proprietary technologies, frameworks, and toolkits.

### Security Developer

This type of developer specializes in creating systems, methods, and procedures to test the security of a software system and exploit and fix security flaws. This type of developer often work as "white-hat" ethical hacker (penetration tester - opposit to "black-hat" hacker) and attempts to penetrate systems to discover vulnerabilities.

Skills: security developers most often write tools in scripting languages such as Python and Ruby and understand in details the many patterns used to attack software systems. More advanced security developers need to read and understand operating systems source code written in C and C++. They might also reverse engineer libraries and commercial software systems to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Cloud Computing / Cloud Engineer

A cloud engineer is an IT professional responsible for any technological duties associated with cloud computing, including design, planning, management, maintenance and support.

The cloud engineer position can be broken into multiple roles, including cloud architect, cloud software engineer, cloud security engineer, cloud systems engineer and cloud network engineer. Each position focuses on a specific type of cloud computing, rather than the technology as a whole. Companies that hire cloud engineers are often looking to deploy cloud services or further their cloud understanding and technology.

Skills: cloud engineers need to be familiar with programming languages including Java, Python and Ruby. Many companies looking to hire cloud engineers seek experience with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, Linux, Rackspace, Google compute engine and Docker.

### Other things you can do

- Software Tools Development. This type of development builds tools for other software developers to test their code with (maybe overlapps with SDET). Skills: Java, Python, C++.
- API Development (maybe overlapps with Solutions Architect). API development is the laying of a foundation of standard procedures, types, tools, GUI interaction methods, and database access rules that programmers building other applications can use for that particular API. Skills: APIs are written for specific platforms or functions, and each API will have the programming language of the platform/device/site/service it’s designed for

## Develop main fundamental skills
  
- [x] English.
- [x] Programming Language:

  - choose language, learn the basics:
    - operators (+, -, %, ...), variables (int a), data types (int, double), syntax
    - control flow (if, switch, while, for, foreach)
    - arrays and memory allocation ([][], [,], new, malloc)
    - object oriented programming (objects, classes, encapsulation using modifiers, inheritance using extend, polymorphishm (using virtual functions - C++))
    - classes and inheritance (public inheritance, protected inheritance...)
    - data structures (vectors, lists, maps...)
    - basic algorithms (sort, quicksort, find, find_if, comparators, predicates, function objects (functors) ...)

  - develop programs with your favorite PL using popular framework.
  - once you got into a comfort zone learn new programming languages. Why you need this:
    - Each programming language build different mental tools. So learning them would make learning abstractions easier. <details><summary>For example:</summary>
      - [x] C => structured programming
      - [x] C++ => generic programming & OO:  which is used for writing most packaged software.
      - [x] Java => object-oriented programming
      - [ ] C#  => delegates, LINQ objects
      - [ ] JavaScript => closure, callbacks,
      - [ ] Erlang => threading, fault tolerance.
      - [ ] Python => list comprehensions, generators (lazy)
      - [x] Matlab => numeric calculations
      - [ ] Haskell => functional programming, monads.
      - [x] OCaml => pattern matching
      - [ ] Common Lisp => lambdas, macros, reader macros,  building dsl etc.
      - [ ] Scheme => Continuations, CPS, etc..
      So learning those languages makes thinking in those concepts easy and possible.</details>
      - Also learning a second language will help you solve problems faster and more efficiently as you will have more choices.
      - It will also help you learn the ins and outs of programming as you see the similarities and differences between languages.
      - Learning new programming languages helps you read and understand documentation faster.
      - By learning other languages, you don’t just add more tools (could be abstraction tools) to your tool belt (or toolbox whatever), you also improve your ability to quickly add more tools in the future!
  - [ ] Debug skills ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)). Debugging will show how the user uses software, how the code is structured, and then where the problem is. Understanding how the software is built makes adding new features to the software a faster process. Debugging will show comparisons of bad code and good code since you will turn the former into the latter. Recognizing bad code that causes bugs will help you write software without bugs when you build new features and other software. Debugging is the best way to learn to write reliable software.
  - [ ] Test writing skills (test-driven development), write extensive unit tests. When you have guiding tests before you have code, you are no longer guessing solutions, you have a way to immediately verify them.
  - [ ] Pick an environment / platforms / frameworks
  - [ ] Master Algorithms and Data Structures
  - [ ] Learn Design Patterns. Put focus on reading and writing design documents.

## Practice logical thinking and analysis (develop problem solver skills)

- [ ] Solve programming challenges (TopCoder, ProjectEuler, UVA, LeetCode, HackerRank, Exercism.io)
  - [x] easy
  - [ ] medium
  - [ ] hard
- [ ] Regularly participate in programming competitions. Popular platforms include HackerRank and TopCoder. They would cement your algorithmic thinking.
- [x] Solve interesting puzzles
- [x] Play puzzle and strategy games

## Build Projects From Scratch

- [ ] Find an experience developer who will be your mentor.

- [ ] Build project based on the core functionality of known projects. <details><summary>For example:</summary>you can write down the essential functionality of Twitter: user login, passwords, posting messages, deleting messages, storing messages and users in a database. Also list out the none essential functionality that you might want to build for your own curiosity: profile pictures, comments, followers. Then go ahead and start coding. The goal with the first project is to learn to write software without guidance from senior developers or from a class homework assignment.</details>

- [ ] Show project to your mentor. He will give you a feedback on code style, code structure, and design. Take that feedback and implement it by rewriting your software. You will see how much you’ve improved during this process.

- [ ] Pick to build something less well defined. <details><summary>For example:</summary>you can build a task list application without basing it on any existing task list apps. The reason for not picking something that already exists is that it forces you to *make* the design decisions. In the Twitter example, all the needed features were easily understood, now it is up to you to *plan accordingly*: an important skill for a senior developer.

- [ ] Again, once you complete this project, get feedback from an experienced developer and implement that feedback.

## Software / tools you should learn

> Note: it is really cool when you don't touch mouse at all.

- [x] Task management software (Jira, Trello)
- [ ] Git
- [x] File Manager:
  - [x] Far - Windows
  - [ ] Ranger - Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
- [x] Terminal Editor / Text Editor /
  - [x] Sublime Text
  - [ ] Visual Studio Code
  - [ ] Vim
- [ ] IDE, configure linters and plugins in your IDE
  - [ ] Visual Studio 2019
  - [ ] IntelliJ IDEA
  - [ ] Eclipse (in Android development)
- [ ] PlantUML
- [ ] A diff'ing tool to see changes in a large text base
- [ ] A profiler to find things you can speed up or slim down in your code
- [ ] A good hexeditor (?) at hand

## Develop communication skills

Good communication skills directly correlate with good development skills. The ability to communicate is crucial for understanding problems clearly, being able to break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. You should be able to learn concepts quickly. This is a skill that improves through practice but you can develop them partially in these ways:

- [ ] Attend meetings with senior developers
- [ ] Work on projects in the main revenue generating department of your company
- [ ] Try to teach a beginner how to code
- [ ] Visit Hackatons
- [ ] Contribute to open source projects on GitHub. You could start off by documenting code, writing tutorials and finding and resolving bugs. Reading a large codebase would give you some perspective on how things work in the real world.
- [ ] Offer teammates help
- [ ] Help others by contributing on platforms like StackOverflow, Reddit. You'll actually be helping yourself  by reading and debugging someone else's code  and learning a lot of subtle things in the process.
- [ ] Get your own pet-project: design from scratch, code, test, deploy an app as an open-source project on GitHub where people would add new features for you. You need to feel all that SDLC stuff and, if you get lucky, extend community around yourself.
- [ ] A good programmer thinks about code, an excellent  programmer thinks about *tickets*. You should note all your communications with the team and the customer in tickets (on Jira/GitHub): what doesn't work, how to fix it, why we need to fix it, our motivations.

## Additional advice

- Drink Coffee. Coffee is your best friend on a long day :coffee:
- Buy good headphones so that no one will distract you :headphones:
- Have a positive attitude :) A good way to keep a positive attitude is to work on projects that are interesting to you. It sounds obvious, but many people will agree to roles they have no interest in. *Playing it safe won’t make you a great developer!*
- Foster deep knowledge: carefully select the technologies you want to work with. Aim to become an expert in a couple - but competent with many.
- Don’t hesitate to learn new technologies (keep up to date with new technologies). Get out of your comfort zone. There is no point in being an expert in dates tech. That’s how you survive in the software industry.
- Improve learning ability. Every programmer will experience a situation where they don't know an answer. The great programmers will work to find that answer. They will look at different resources, talk to the right people and find the solution no matter what. *Great developers have mastered the skill of self-learning.*
- Read code from best programmers:
  - Peter Norvig => python, common lisp
  - Edi Weitz , Robert Smith => common lisp.
  - Andrei Alexandrescu => C++
  - Linus Torvalds => C
- Keep on writing, try to optimize everything (your work, surfing, etc.) with your scripts
- Play with your code, push the limit by improving your code, optimize it, try to run program on big values. You will learn a lot.
- Be a Team Player. Great developers help other developers improve. They offer teammates help when they are stuck, teach new skills to others and write documentation that would help teammates not only in their organization but the developer community in general.
- Repository will fight with coders. If repository doesn't have *continious integration*, *static analysis*, *unit tests*, *navigation tests*, there are no configured *code review processes*, there are no closed *master* branch... then this is the end for repository. It can't survive in fight with developers.
- Expertise is overrated: as much as specific skill expertise is important, it shouldn’t be the single factor you focus on. *A great (insert any skill here) developer is not necessarily a great developer.* It’s the addition of the soft skills above that make them great.

> ru: например, web developer (его hard skill - web) - это лишь добавление к мягким навыкам сверху, которое делает их (soft skills) отличными. Отсюда выходит мое предположение: soft skills - основы, на которых строятся hard skills.

> The ability to learn quickly and jump into a project seamlessly, to help others out, to always have a great attitude. These are the skills that make you invaluable to a business.

- Programming needs to be a habit in your life in order to get really good with it. Also it is very important to сode in a team. So, the best advice consists of two things:
  - Write Code Every Day
  - Hang out with other people who code :handshake:
