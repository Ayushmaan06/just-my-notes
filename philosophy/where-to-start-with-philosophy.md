## Terminology

### What is philosophy?

As with most disciplines, "philosophy" has both a casual and a technical usage.

In its casual use, "philosophy" may refer to nearly any sort of thought or beliefs, and subsume topics such as religion, mysticism, and even science. When someone asks you what "your philosophy" is, this is the sort of sense they have in mind; they're asking about your general system of thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.

In its technical use -- the use relevant here at [/r/philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy) -- it is a more specific study. Philosophy can be broadly grouped into several major areas:

- [Epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/), the study of knowledge and belief.
- Logic, the study of what follows from what.
- [Metaphysics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/), the study of the basic nature of existence and reality.
- [Value Theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/), which includes ethics/moral philosophy, political philosophy, aesthetics, and similar areas.
- Philosophy of Science and Mathematics, including Philosophy of Mind.

Philosophy in this narrower sense is defined not only by its subject matter, but by its methodology and attitudes. Something is not philosophical merely because it states some position related to those areas. There must also be an emphasis on *argument* (setting forward reasons for adopting a position) and a willingness to subject any and all positions to criticism.

### What *isn't* philosophy?

Even in its narrower sense, philosophy can be difficult to demarcate. Nevertheless, the following generalizations are useful as rules-of-thumb. A position is not philosophical if:

- It does not address or reduce to one of the studies shown in the previous section.
- It may be more productively addressed through some other discipline (e.g., science).
- No attempt is made to argue for a position's conclusions or it is forbidden to subject the position to criticism.

Some more specific topics which are popularly misconstrued as philosophical, but do *not* meet this definition (and should not be posted about in [/r/philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy)):

- Mysticism. ("I meditated today and experienced the oneness of the universe...")
- Drug experiences. ("I dropped acid today and experienced the oneness of the universe...")
- Self-help. ("How can I be a happier person and have more people like me?")
- Trite sayings, quotes, or other clichÃ©s presented as fact. ("We are the universe experiencing itself.")
- "The love of wisdom." The word "philosophy" does come from the Greek words for "wisdom" and "love," but the meaning of the word itself is much more specific.

### Why is philosophy important?

Philosophical questions often have no *direct* bearing on the sorts of things people care about. Philosophy doesn't produce technology or feelings of comfort and self-actualization. This can lead many to think that philosophy is not important or engaged with questions that don't really matter.

Philosophy tends to be about the most *fundamental* issues. For instance, you may ask, "Why is the sky blue?" For this you would naturally be directed to a physicist for an answer. You might further ask, "How can the physicist know her theories really tell us anything about reality?" For this, you need a philosopher. Philosophy deals with the fundamental questions that ground all disciplines -- and indeed, all human knowledge-seeking endeavours.

Another common question is whether philosophy is actually capable of accomplishing this task. There are many questions and problems that philosophers try to solve, and some of those problems are very old; the fact that a question remains open after thousands of years may lead some to think that it isn't solvable. However, this does not mean philosophy does not progress. While there may in many cases be no final, universally-agreed-upon answers, there will be *better* answers than those of a thousand years ago and a more thorough and rigorous understanding of the problems themselves. In this sense philosophy is like science: it is a continuing process of trial and error, and to retire from this process is to retire from searching for the truth. We still have no final, conclusive understanding, but we have better theories than we did before -- as long as we continue to subject our theories to criticism, if we try hard, and if we are lucky, we may in time better approximate the truth.

### Good General Overviews

This section divides into two: short, broad overviews, and more extensive histories.

#### Short, Broad Overviews

Two good places to start are [Simon Blackburn's book *Think* ](http://smile.amazon.com/Think-A-Compelling-Introduction-Philosophy/dp/0192854259)and [Julian Baggini's *The Pig That Wants to be Eaten*](http://smile.amazon.com/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448). The Blackburn book clearly and concisely goes through most of the large areas of philosophy and talks about how various philosophers have thought about them. The Baggini book presents interesting little thought experiments and puzzles that can help acquaint you with some of the interesting and odd topics that philosophers have addressed. Both books provide enough citations for you to start digging on your own once you've identified things you find interesting.

#### More Specific Places to Start

We'll subdivide this into two sections. First, there are some good places to start for philosophy generally, if you're the sort of person who says "it's all interesting - I don't want to specialize!" Second, there are good places to start for various topics.

##### Good Places to Start for Philosophy Generally

As mentioned above, **Plato** is a good place to dive in. He sits near the beginning of the Western philosophical tradition, his writing is often engaging, he covers practically every topic, and he was massively influential. In addition to [this collection of five dialogues](http://smile.amazon.com/Plato-Dialogues-Euthyphro-Apology-Classics/dp/0872206335/), Plato's *Republic* is a masterpiece that touches on many areas of philosophy and which has often served as the first introduction students get to the field.

*The Meditations* by **Marcus Aurelius** are focused on Stoicism, an overarching philosophy somewhat popular in Greek and Roman times. The somewhat personal style and the wide range of topics he touches on, plus the historical interest of reading something written not just by a philosopher but also an Emperor of Rome, make it a fun introduction to philosophy for many people.

**Descartes** was a revolutionary thinker who helped usher in the modern period. Two great places to start with Descartes are his *Discourse on the Method* and his *Meditations on First Philosophy*, both of which are available [here](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/descartes).

##### Good Places to Start for Specific Topics

We're subdividing again! One option is to go for primary sources - classic works in philosophy on these topics. Another option is to go for introductory textbooks or compilations of works.

###### Primary Sources

Everyone has a favorite philosopher for any given topic, but it's always a different philosopher depending on who you ask. So, this section could balloon almost infinitely. But it won't. So, keep in mind that for every philosopher that's listed here, there are three others that someone might say "no, read THIS PERSON first!" That's life.

Moreover, philosophy is a super broad field. We cannot here cover every topic. That's also life.

This list skews slightly early in history, because it is generally better to start closer to the beginning. Sometimes people find it more exciting to jump in closer to the modern age. If that's the case, I recommend introductory textbooks listed below.

Finally, I am not super familiar with non-Western Philosophy. Unless someone with more knowledge comes along and offers some suggestions (thus allowing me to remove this disclaimer) the list below is *very* parochial. (Also, I've left off all of medieval philosophy since I think it's often boring for newcomers. Sorry. If you have some exciting medievals to suggest, I can add them to the list.)

For **epistemology**, which is the study of knowledge and how we come to have it, Plato's *Theaetetus*, [Descartes's *Discourse on the Method* and *Meditations on First Philosophy*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/descartes), [Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/locke), [Leibniz's *New Essays on Human Understanding*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz) (read that right after Locke), [Berkeley's *The Principles of Human Knowledge*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/berkeley), and [Hume's *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume).

For **metaphysics**, which is the study of what exists, what existence is, and why things do or don't exist, all that stuff up there in the epistemology section, minus Locke, Leibniz, and Hume, and plus Plato's *Phaedo*, maybe Aristotle's *Metaphysics* (it's tough), [Leibniz's *Discourse on Metaphysics* and *Monadology*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz) and [Kant's *Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

For **aesthetics**, which is the study of beauty and art, Plato's *Hippias Major*, Aristotle's *Poetics*, [Hume's *The Standard of Taste*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and if you're up for it, Kant's *Critique of Judgment*.

For **ethics**, Plato's *Republic*, Mozi's *Mozi*, Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, [Hume's *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and [Kant's *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

For **political philosophy**, Plato's *Republic* and *Crito*, Aristotle's *Politics*, Cicero's *On the Commonwealth* and *On the Laws*, [Machiavelli's *The Prince*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/machiavelli), [Hobbes's *Leviathan*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hobbes), and [Locke's *Second Treatise of Government*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/locke).

For **existentialism and absurdism**, [Sartre's *Existentialism is a Humanism*](http://smile.amazon.com/Existentialism-Humanism-Jean-Paul-Sartre/dp/0300115466/) and [Camus's *The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays*](http://smile.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Other-Essays/dp/0679733736/).

For **philosophy of science**, which is the study of what science is and how science comes to know things, [Mill's *A System of Logic* book III](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/mill), Popper's *Conjectures and Refutations*, [Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*](http://smile.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary/dp/0226458121/), and *For and Against Method* edited by Motterlini. Lots of people find Mill boring, though, and philosophy of science is rather new, so you might be better served by the textbooks or compilations listed below.

For **feminism**, [Wollstonecraft's *A Vindication of the Rights of Women*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/wollstonecraft), [Mill's (or Mill and Taylor Mill's) *The Subjection of Women*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/mill), and [de Beauvoir's *The Second Sex*](https://smile.amazon.com/Second-Sex-Simone-Beauvoir/dp/030727778X/).

> Also, I found [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TpHPEo3pG-QlB7dWCF-fcJFgayFmlQia-RjpKQGFP4A/edit#) from /r/Feminism while searching feminist literature on [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6a5d9h/what_is_your_favourite_piece_of_feminist/).

For **philosophy of religion**, Plato's *Euthyphro*, [Leibniz's *Making the Case for God*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz), [Hume's *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* and *The Immortality of the Soul*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and [Kant's *Religion Within the Boundaries of Bare Reason*](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

###### Introductory Textbooks

Maybe you want something that covers more ground faster, or that's pitched towards the modern reader, or which doesn't assume any prior knowledge. In that case, textbooks are good.

### Philosophy of Science

Philosophers have often been preoccupied with science; scientists have often been preoccupied with philosophy. From its origins until the present moment, the philosophy of science has often been a driven mixture of the two groups. Thus, modern history of philosophy of science often begins with three principle figures who had a feet in both worlds: [Rene Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/), [Francis Bacon](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/), and [Isaac Newton](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton/), whose [philosophy of science](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-philosophy/) has recently received increased attention. A number of modern philosophersâsuch as [Locke](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-philosophy-science/), [Hume](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-newton/) and [Kant](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-science/)âare also recognized as having had important and influential discussions of science.

Contemporary philosophy of science can be traced back to the turn of the century, and the influence that a number of scientist-philosophersâsuch as [Henri Poincare](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/poincare/), [Pierre Duhem](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duhem/) (whose *The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory* is still often read the philosophy of science classes), [Albert Einstein](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/), and [Ernest Mach](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/)âhad on the [logical empiricists](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/) of the [Vienna Circle](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/). The Vienna Circle was instrumental in bringing a focus on the philosophy of science to the Anglo-American philosophical community, particularly through the (contrasting) works of Rudolf Carnap (seriously, SEP?) and [Karl Popper](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/). Particular classics from this period include:

- Nelson Goodman. *Fact, Fiction, and Forecast* (1955).
- Karl Popper. *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (1959).
- Ernest Nagel. *The Structure of Science* (1961).

### Political Philosophy

### Truth

[Truth](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/) is an ancient topic in philosophy. Traditionally, two theories--[correspondence](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/) and [coherence](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/)--have dominated the discussion about what truth amounts to.

## Shops

### World

- [**Amazon**](https://smile.amazon.com/Comics-Graphic-Novels-Books/b?ie=UTF8&node=4366). Note that Amazon also has a large selection of digital comics, and most of them link to your ComiXology account if you have one--it'll say whether or not this is the case on each comic's page. Additionally, their prices are frequently better for digital collected editions than one can find on ComiXology, but not always.
