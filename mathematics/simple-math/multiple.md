# Multiple

## Definition

Multiple (b) - a number divided by a given integer number (a) without a remainder.

Formula: b = n * a where n is called the multiplier.

> In mathematics, when a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a, then a is called a divisor of b.

## Examples

12 is a multiple of 3 [ru: 12 кратно 3, то есть 12 - кратное]

8 bytes is a multiple of 4 bytes

"each object uses a multiple of 8 bytes" [ru: ... кратное восьми байтам] or "objects have to be a multiple of 8 bytes."

> The last example I found in course of Algorithms. That means that if your object has a memory which is not a multiple of 8 then padding of that object gets larger to make your object a multiple of 8 bytes.
