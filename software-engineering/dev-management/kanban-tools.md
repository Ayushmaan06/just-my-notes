This excellent project collaboration tool is widely used in software development, digital marketing, construction, innovative solutions and among other cases where there is a steady workflow of tasks. The Kanban approach helps teams to visualize workflow, analyze processes and achieve greater task management efficiencies. In this post, we describe 14 Kanban tools with advanced features. Compare them and choose the best one right for your needs!

In brief, Kanban is a project management method aimed to minimize multitasking, improve work in progress efficiency, and streamline the speed and quality of the work.
The method is widely applied by collaborative and self-managing teams.

The well-defined Kanban board software will ensure your focusing on priorities, keeping your team in the loop about what’s current and what’s coming up, and controlling steady workflows, especially in production, maintenance, and support. 

An efficient Kanban tool will help you to manage Agile development, thanks to boards and cards, activity streams, swimlanes, charts, and additional features helpful in visualization and managing workflows.

## What composes a forceful Kanban tool?

- A Kanban board – the system that is aimed to organize your cards with Swimlanes, WIP limits, Sub-columns, standard column categories («To-do”, “In progress” and “Done”), tasks with checklists, multiple members, attachments, and time tracking.
- A Kanban card – an element of the Kanban system that assigns tasks with checklists and attachments. It offers different views, the ability to link tasks, add task hierarchy and assign to resources.
- Analytics, reporting system that allows creating reports.
- Integrations – the ability of the tool to integrate easily with other project management systems.
- Automation — the ability to customize the workflow to suit your project environment.

## Best Kanban-focused project management tools

### JIRA

Describing JIRA, they usually say “powerful”. This is truly a multifunctional project management tool that allows development teams to plan tasks, assign performers, plan sprints, manage backlogs, set priorities, and deadlines.

JIRA provides a large number of filtering settings, convenient visualization, detailed reports, and a cozy time tracker.

Doubts: JIRA is well suited to tech teams, but small companies and startups simply cannot use the full breadth of the service’s functionality. There is no possibility of assigning several performers to a single task, and there is also no possibility to share the timeline. To do this, JIRA offers to purchase the paid “Portfolio for Jira”.

### Trello

Trello is a popular management tool that allows organizing tasks, to-do lists, initiatives, discussions, and ideas on one board. The service is quite simple and intuitive, and many companies just need its basic free version to work. Let's say, Trello is suitable for everyone who needs basic Kanban boards functionality.

Doubts: Trello does not have its own time tracking, so you will have to pay for other software (for example, Everhour or Toggle). In addition, Trello does not have WIP limits (Work in Progress), Swimlanes (horizontal columns) and Burndown charts.

### ZenHub

The main advantage of ZenHub is that it integrates natively with GitHub user interface, so developers stay in the habitual environment and project managers may get total visibility about the development process.

The tool may be used to organize, plan, and run Sprints with existing GitHub issues and development flow. There is no need for special training — ZenHub is widely used by both the product and engineering teams. The main features are Kanban-like task boards, to-do lists, Burndown charts, time estimations, Slack integration, etc.

Doubts: Zenhub doesn't provide you with plenty of analytics and reporting features. The UX has some essential quirks that can disturb randomly.
