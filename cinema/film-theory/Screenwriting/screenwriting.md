# Screenwriting

First, what takes time isn't necessarily writing the actual screenplay. Rather, it's mapping out your story. You need to know the dogmas about structure in order to break them. For a quick walk-through of structure: "Save the Cat" by Blake Snyder(very simplified, but good to get started). For a more thorough articulation: "Story" by Robert McKee.

The key take-away from books like these is how you should not go straight to typing. Map out your story first.

Once you've got your beat sheets, your synopsis, your treatment, your outline, your character notes, then you start writing. You can use Amazon storywriter for that. Or final draft(it's a bit expensive, though). When using one of those, you won't have to worry about layout.

Lastly, read lots of screenplays. If there's a screenplay you want to read, google it. Say you want to read the brilliant screenplay for "Nightcrawler" just google *nightcrawler screenplay .pdf*.

When you start reading screenplays, you'll notice that the best films(in all aspects) lean on a solid screenplay.

There's two reasons for that.

One: Good directors know what to look for in a screenplay.

Second: A well-written screenplay makes it soooo much easier to shoot. Actors, for example, doesn't get their cues from their lines. They get them from the sub-text(what's between the lines). And a good screenwriter only writes what's necessary, making anyone involved in the creative process able to interpret, not be dictated.

Syd Field, "Screenplay." (book)

Listen to a couple of episodes of "Draft Zero"(podcast).

Read everything Charlie Kaufman, Aaron Sorkin, Ingmar Bergman, Spike Jonze, Quentin Tarantino has ever written. Compare their styles, find out what works and why. Don' bother trying to find what *doesn't* work.

The best piece of advise I've been given is this: If you want to be a good writer, write.

> I'd also add [Writing Movies for Fun and Profit](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Movies-Fun-Profit-Billion/dp/1439186766/) by former "State" members Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant. It's more about gaming the Hollywood studios and giving them what they typically want.

How to Make Money for Profit by Garant and Lennon. it has some practical info like formatting.

the most informative, useful book I've read on writing is The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri

---

Film Crit Hulk's Screenwriting 101 is the best book. A lot of critics of the 3 act structure that dominates mediocre blockbuster fare will advise against the philosophy behind Story and Save the Cat, but those are the most popular.

Check out [r/screenwriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/)'s FAQ, it's a very good starting point. All the education I have on screenwriting comes from that subreddit and my first short film won an International Screenwriter's Association award, so I've got a lot to thank them for!
