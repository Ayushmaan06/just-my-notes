# Constructing jokes

According to [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joke), a **joke** is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a *pun* or other word play such as *irony* or *sarcasm*, a *logical incompatibility*, *nonsense*, or *other means*.

## Pun

The [**pun**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pun), also called **paronomasia**, is a form of [word play](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Word_play) that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended [humorous](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Humor) or [rhetorical](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rhetoric) effect.

## Irony

[**Irony**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Irony) in its broadest sense, is a [rhetorical device](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rhetorical_device), [literary technique](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Literary_technique), or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case or to be expected differs radically from what is actually the case.

## Sarcasm

[**Sarcasm**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sarcasm) is "a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression or remark; a bitter gibe or [taunt](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taunt)". Sarcasm may employ [ambivalence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ambivalence), although sarcasm is not necessarily ironic. Most noticeable in spoken word, sarcasm is mainly distinguished by the inflection with which it is spoken and is largely [context](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Context_(language_use))-dependent.

In its entry on [irony](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Irony), [Dictionary.com](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dictionary.com) describes sarcasm thus:

> In sarcasm, ridicule or mockery is used harshly, often crudely and contemptuously, for destructive purposes. It may be used in an indirect manner, and have the form of irony, as in "What a fine musician you turned out to be!," "It's like you're a whole different person now...," and "Oh... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years!" or it may be used in the form of a direct statement, "You couldn't play one piece correctly if you had two assistants." The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal inflection ...

Distinguishing sarcasm from [banter](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Banter), and referring to the use of irony in sarcasm, Derek Bousfield writes that sarcasm is:

> The use of strategies which, *on the surface* appear to be appropriate to the situation, but are meant to be taken as meaning the opposite in terms of *face management*. That is, the utterance which appears, on the surface, to maintain or enhance the face of the recipient actually attacks and damages the face of the recipient. ... *sarcasm* is an insincere form of politeness which is used to offend one's interlocutor.

Professionals in psychology and related fields have long looked upon sarcasm negatively, particularly noting that sarcasm tends to be a maladaptive [coping mechanism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coping_mechanism) for those with unresolved anger or frustrations. Psychologist Clifford N. Lazarus describes sarcasm as "[hostility](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hostility) disguised as humor". ... Lazarus suggests that too frequent use of sarcasm tends to "overwhelm the emotional flavor of any conversation"

## Structure of a joke

The whole structure is next: Framing → Telling → Punchline → Responding (laughter).

### Framing

[Framing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frame_analysis) is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. "Have you heard the one…", "Reminds me of a joke I heard…", "So, a lawyer and a doctor…"; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows. Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in "this is no joking matter" or "this is no time for jokes".

### Telling

Following its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.

The narrative always contains a protagonist who becomes the "butt" or target of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify [stereotypes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stereotypes) within the culture. It also enables researchers to group and analyse the creation, persistence and interpretation of joke cycles around a certain character. Some people are naturally better performers than others, however anyone can tell a joke because the comic trigger is contained in the narrative text and punchline. A joke poorly told is still funny unless the punchline gets mangled.

### Punchline

The punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline / response is elucidated by [Victor Raskin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Victor_Raskin) in his [Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theories_of_humor#Script-based_Semantic_Theory_of_Humor). Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text **AND** opposite or incompatible with each other.

### Responding

Expected response to a joke is [laughter](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Laughter). The joke teller hopes the audience "gets it" and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an "understanding test" between individuals and groups. If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do "get it" and don't laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience.

### In short

> From Anoir's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpw-eVIljo&t=1004s).

Any joke consists of two stories. The first story is one that pushes you to an assumption that turns out to be false. The second story, or a punhline, is the sudden revelation of a previously unknown fact.

By the way, this video also mentions such a thing as a **premise**. It can be described as a seed from which the whole story grows. Also, in this video (17:10) premise is called a joke, from which even more funny joke is born.

The premise concept is also used in Stand Ups. According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/axml0y/what_exactly_is_a_premise/), premise means the subject of the joke, or what the joke is about, its simple idea.

> For example:
>
> The joke: "Take my wife: please!" :)
>
> "Take my wife" is the premise (a seed), "please!" is the punchline. And this punchline is the <u>pun</u> we talked about above. "Please" is not only a polite request, but also a verb that means bringing enjoyment :)

The issues a lot of comics run into is they think premises are punchlines “The first and last birthday you have are the same” will get some chuckles but you have to get the punchlines to get a really successful bit.

So, we can say that premise in short way can combine both Framing and Telling. It's just an idea, a seed from which the joke flows into the punchline and, in general, is born. And it's even good. After all, the shorter and clearer the joke (without any complications), the easier it is to make people laugh at it. If to overcomplicate the premise/punchline adding not necessary facts and make it even more funny, the joke may not work in the end.

> Considering the premise in the video, I'm sure that premise can be determined recursively:
>
> premise = an idea about a joke | a joke which is an idea for another joke
