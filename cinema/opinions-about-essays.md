# Opinions about essays

## Does anyone else feel as though we are becoming oversaturated with sub-par, uninteresting, almost pointless video essays?

1324 (OP): I remember in late 2014/early 2015 when **EveryFrameAPaiting** was just starting to have huge success in the youtube space. It was when I first discovered the idea of a "video essay".

I remember soon after they started popping up everywhere, and before you knew it, there were 10-15 quality video essay channels that covered a multitude of topics, but most of them were film-based. The content was varied and had stylistic nuances from creator to creator.

Then somewhere along the line that totally changed.

This post was largely inspired by a video that was uploaded a mere hour ago as I write this. It's a video from thenerdwriter called [How Ian McKellen Acts With His Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLXHViyW7I). This video basically a culmination of everything I have come to hate about video essays.

For the entire video, which is about 3.5 minutes too long in my opinion, he is essentially describing that actors often use their eyes to express different emotions. There is no effort to move past surface-level observations such as "in this scene he moves his eyes to the right, indicating that he's thinking about doing something" and "his eyes are panicked so we feel panicked".

It would be unfair of me to solely single out thenerdwriter in this example but, there are plenty of others out there. After a quick search, I found [Edgar Wright - How to edit to a beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxw7LGGNLYY) by konradnoises. It's essentially a 10-minute video where he explains the simple concept of how the editor of *Baby Driver* cut the footage of a film to match the beat of a 4/4 song. He makes no efforts to go into how this kind of technique could immerse a viewer, or what it could mean in the context of a film's story.

I have noticed that with the sheer volume of these videos, almost all of them fail to use some kind of external sources like an essay or an interview to corroborate what they trying to say. They just think their word is gospel and doesn't need to be evaluated in any kind of meaningful way. It's almost like they don't understand the concept of a video ESSAY.

Most of these videos just feel like various different people describing that movies, do in fact, exist for a nocuous amount of time. Mercifully concluding with a half-assed philosophical statement about movies that is barely related to the (already shaky) point that they were trying to make.

Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm going fucking crazy because some of these channels have millions of subscribers, hundreds of comments pointing out how amazing they are, and have videos that are shared by legitimate news outlets as if they are completely unfamiliar with the basic idea of a film.

Someone, please enlighten me as to what I'm missing or wrong about here because I'm losing my mind over this.

edit: clarity and spelling mistakes



405: I did my degree in film and media studies and some of these videos are basically extensions of the throwaway comments some of the more irritating members of my class would make. Again, these people had an opinion on something, thought they were absolutely correct and it wasn't open to interpretation, and didn't back it up with any theory. Or if they did, they'd mention a theory in passing but not go into any specifics.

And that's why Jaws is about toothed vaginas.

> But the popularity of EFAP ushered in or at least popularized a whole movement of film analysis through video essays on YouTube. It’s the same as with any movement in art or media, an original idea takes off and hundreds of thousands will try to replicate it but only a handful will be genuine and well thought out.

> It’s worth it when you find something sincerely insightful but I definitely agree that I’ve found many essays where I get to the end of a 15 minute video and I feel that I’ve learned nothing at all

> > > > > 18: I dunno, Lindsay Ellis, while not being the hack that the nerd writer is , has come out with some utter nonsense. Like her video on auteur theory , where she stated that taking a closer look at a film as significant and commercially successful as transformers can “illuminate the desires and wants of a culture” yet is completely dismissive of Godard and Fellini, two filmmakers who, despite what you may think of them, created work that was extremely influential and quite successful at the time. Piere goes wild was the 4th highest grossing film in France the year it came out and Godard has influenced everyone from Scorsese to mallick to Tarantino. I’m personally not a huge fan of Godard but making him and Fellini out to be the film equivalent of shitty performance art is just lazy. She’s a good example of a breed of mainstream film snobs who swear by Hollywood and turn their noses up at anything else, which is just as pretentious as snobby cinephiles who drool over Tarkovsky and shit on anything else.
> > > > >
> > > > > > 4: I actually see her point. The very fact that movies like Transformers are big hits, DO show the desires and the quality of a given culture. If it didn't, people would not go see these films. As for the artsy directors like Godard or Fellini, they might have influenced directors, but not the general public in the US. The new crop of directors in the late '70s did get influenced, but they TRANSLATED that style to a more commercial style. That's how it works for music too: look at "indie" music in the 2000s, like experimental stuff like Animal Collective, and even chillwave. 10 years later, and you now find these influences in pop HITS, but commercialized to not come out too weird. Look at high quality TV shows today. If you were presented such an episode to someone in the '70s, they'd think it's experimental film. But it's commercial today. That's how it works: whatever is experimental today, gets trasnformed and becomes commercial later. But each era has its own experimental stuff.
> > > > > >
> > > > > > > 4: Yeah I don’t really see what you’re arguing here, that was pretty much my point, there is a constant cross pollination between commercial and non-commercial filmmaking and disregarding one or the other is just silly. I agree with what she said about transformers, but she disregarded the the others as being “artsy hacks”.Also, while they may not have been huge in the US Godard and Fellini did enjoy commercial success in their native countries Pierre le fou was one of the highest grossing films in France the year it was released, the term paparazzi came from fellini’s La dolce vita - anexample of “artsy” films influencing pop culture.Just because something isn’t huge in the us doesn’t make it irrelevant, that’s American exceptionalism at its worst. Commercial cinema is great sometimes, Hollywood used to be a dream factory but there is no denying the fact that bureaucracy and commercial restraints occasionally stunt artistry. This is what I don’t like about Lindsay Ellis, she swears by the Hollywood system the same way elitist snobs swear by art house films and turn their noses up at anything else, temperamentally they’re one and the same.Commercial cinema in general is not representative of the breadth of cinema, there are plenty of great films that could never be made in Hollywood, because ultimately, studios play it safe most of the time, which is understandable, their primary concern is profit and that is fine but Hollywood is not the be all end all of film, there are rich cinematic cultures all over the world. That’s all I was really getting at.

> 60: Absolutely agree about LFTS, his content is amazing and I feel like I always learn something from him. He consistently quotes from one book (Story by Robert McKee) but honestly he makes it work every single time. He's the bar on video essays for me now.

> > 37: *Like Stories Of Old* also cites a wide variety of texts in his essays and incorporates them really nicely into his theses

108: I know people may disagree, but I think almost all video essays have fallen prey to this. Even the ones you mention that you prefer. They're rather uninformative and unimaginative when it comes to being video essays or just a video about videos, in my opinion. If people are interested in these topics that they see on youtube, I would recommend going online and searching articles and books concerning said topics.

Most of the video essays being used for information have taken that information from other sources. These sources usually have more content and room for that content because of their focus, rather than throwaway lines devoted to certain discussions. I've searched up and down for many years and am still yet to find anything inspiring when it comes to video essays.

Obviously all of this is my opinion, I've seen plenty of film fans find youtube channels and videos they feel explain movies or moviemaking well. As I said, I've just found the majority of these uninformative and/or uninspiring.

> 64: If people are interested in these topics that they see on youtube, I would recommend going online and searching articles and books concerning said topics.
>
> I think this is kind of an obvious truth. But not everyone wants in depth knowledge about everything (not to mention that this is not really possible), and video essays boil things down into easily consumable portions. I can spend 10 minutes learning a little, or spend a couple weeks thoroughly researching. If all I want is the high level, I don't really care to get that thorough research. And, if it turns out that I'm extremely interested in a topic presented by a video essay, I'm free to go do more digging. Or if it turns out I wasn't interested at all, I've only wasted 10 minutes instead of several weeks finding that out.
>
> They're for folks like myself who prefer to know a little about a lot, as opposed to a lot about a little. To each his own.

34: More people should follow the *Kogonada* style of just letting the images and editing do the explaining for you. Film 101 level analysis won't make for a thoughtful or intriguing video of Nolan or Tarantino footage.

Just let them die on the internet with no views, just like everything else that isn't really worth talking about in earnest.

33: I agree that the most popular video essays tend to be a bit shallower than one would like on this sub. However, this doesn't really bother me because that's what the videos are designed to do. Having a wider audience will usually mean dumbing things down, whether that's in video essays or films themselves. Most people are not prepared for the in depth discussion that we crave on this sub, and *that's ok*. Video essayists like nerdwriter serve a purpose, and that purpose is to simply introduce some level of critical film viewing, and not to do a film school level deep dive on a concept or technique. I watch his videos because they get me thinking about something that I might not have today, and then from there I can go deeper on my own if I wish.

26: It's honestly just the flaws of Youtube. Youtube has a low bar to entry and attracts blogger/vlogger types who are more interested in hearing their own voices (or making money) than actual academic pursuits or critical discussion.

It's why I don't take youtube seriously as a media outlet. There's a lot of good stuff on there, but for the most part it trends toward click-bait, low-budget production, uncited sourcing, hype over substance. I doubt many of those people have ever taken a film studies class or a screenwriting class. Or if they have, they know enough that successful youtube channels don't educate, but they entertain to retain subscribers.

And sadly, the more popular the channel, the worse they tend to be, because their content is dumbed down for mass views, and not substance. And the inverse is true too - if someone were to make a channel meeting your criteria for a proper video essay, it'd get like 8,000 views and wallow in obscurity.

There's a reason Youtube is never going to catch up to TV or big streaming services like Netflix as a real alternative. Call me elitist, but when almost all your content is cheaply-made, short, unsourced, and lives or dies by a 24/7 trend cycle of needing eyeballs to survive, and literally anyone can join in, it's inevitably going to be subpar content, clickbait, or appeal to the uninformed with style over substance (and often with healthy doses of misinformation tossed in). This isn't limited to film either, in almost every one of my hobbies or pursuits I can name popular Youtuber personalities who are full of shit making bad content for people who don't know better.

- Examples:

[Confused Matthew: The Matrix Reloaded Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYWRSNQGu2o). I LOVE this guy's videos because he basically reviews films for archetypes and from a philosophical storytelling perspective. It's clearly low-budget (because it's super-old) and there is no slick production. He basically calls out all the philosophical bullshit in Matrix Revolutions for what it is, tells you **why** it is wrong, cites his sources, and explains things well. He also has that nerd humor that works. His videos have been around since 2008 and got so few views he deleted his channel until he reuploaded them when he started working with other channels. **View Count: 18,182**

[CinemaSins: Everything Wrong With The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uVkKKxDA6c). Lame bullshit video essay with snarky comments like "The Jesus metaphor is too literal" and "Badass chick Gina Torres from Firefly gets only 30 seconds in this movie" and a video mostly about irrelevant plot holes, and an occasional good point that, still, doesn't really advance any critical discussion about the movie, just shits on it. Ultimately, the video doesn't have a point; it is a collection of bad riffs. He also has that nerd humor that I find obnoxious, but somehow is really popular on Youtube. **View Count: nearly 4 million**

**TL;DR**: Like [/u/Nefarious_Dr_Rhubarb](https://old.reddit.com/u/Nefarious_Dr_Rhubarb)[ ](javascript:void 0) said above, to be popular, 99% of these videos are full of D- caliber uncited bullshit that sounds cool and means nothing.

25: I pretty much agree with everything you said. I think one of the main issues for this is that content creators are afraid of making argumentative videos, which results in them not saying anything substantial. In other words, most video essayists seem to want to produce uncontroversial, informative, almost encyclopedic videos, but they often lack the required expertise to make such videos interesting. For instance, if you're analyzing a movie from a technical standpoint, talking about lens usages and camera angles, etc., then it may make an interesting video for most of the audience.

Look at, for instance, Patrick (H) Willems or Lindsay Ellis. They employ their technical background to make videos that are, while being informative, also making arguments. Especially Patrick's almost every video makes an highly controversial argument, and I disagree with about half of them, but he makes interesting arguments in a proper essay format, so I watch his videos.

Also, Lindsay Ellis's videos on the Hobbit are still the best video essays on YouTube on film, I think.

3: I’ll be completely honest here, I feel like I haven’t seen enough of them? Or at least I haven’t seen enough that are good enough quality-wise, to sit down and watch the entire video. I’ve found quite a few where the narration has been rushed, lacking eloquence or simply difficult to understand, and others where the ideas they are presenting are simply too analytical to the point of pretentiousness.

I hope someone responds to your thread with some of the better channels producing video essays out there. It’s something I’d want to see more of.

Keep in mind, these are just my opinion and are also dependent on the entertainment I get from these essays as well as their "educational" content.

Edit: added more suggestions

> 33: **Lindsay Ellis** is really good as well.
>
> > 22: Hard agree here, while I only minored in film and didn’t get too exposed to film academia, Ellis’s videos are the only ones I’ve seen that actually approach the academic style of film criticism that I remember reading in school. She is also one of the few people who actually look at a film in terms of a larger social context, like her Whole Plate series.
> >
> > It seems the vast majority of video essays out there are all about form, which is fine, but it ignores the huge percentage of film criticism concerned with things like ideology, feminism, etc. There are too many videos that are “the (insert formal technique) in (insert massively acclaimed movie) is good because it’s good”

## Problematic trends in the current video essayist boom?

190: 

**EDIT:** Several folks have said that they were interested in specific channels, or have been creating their own video essays. Please do link these channels/videos for others to subscribe to! I know I'm always looking for new content--particularly from fellow [r/TrueFilm](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/) posters!

------

Today, I thought it might be interesting to discuss the boom in film-centric video essayists on Youtube and elsewhere on the internet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZhFtd1QZWc

I am interested, myself, in dicussing this video from 2015 I found today from the channel "Now You See It" by video essayist Jack Nugent. Exploring the power of opening shots, he makes several symbolic inferences, several of which are at best first-order concerns, or even seem contrary to the actual themes of the films he analyzes. He also makes several factual errors about the plot points of the films he's working from.

In general, he's doing interesting work, but it's something I might label as "90% right," which makes his analyses somewhat uncanny or alienating. (EDIT: For another example of this, folks might be interested in [his essay on the symbolic phallus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV5jcXT3USw), which is much better than this one, but also has some errors.)

Some examples:

- he claims that our first look is "away from earth" in a shot of the Earth being occluded in *2001: A Space Odyssey*. He then states that "this movie isn't about people, but it's about humanity as a whole," and "this story centers on life on Earth." Of course, neither of these things are actually true. In claiming that the original shot communicates the overall themes, plot, or content of the film, this claim immediately falls flat.
- He concludes that "this movie is about humanity, it's about life on Earth, and it's about the journey life on Earth has gone through. From this shot we know exactly what the plot will be about." This is, overall, a *bizarre* analysis of a film about the *future* of humanity, through a story *off Earth*, through the story of an *individual character*.
- I'll not comment on *Silver Linings Playbook*, because I haven't seen the film.
- He factually misnames the winner of the Miss America pageant in *Little Miss Sunshine* as the runner-up (Ms. Louisiana) rather than Miss Kansas (information from the very shot he's using).
- Further arguments of his on this film are, he admits, inference from the visual here, but they're also *wrong.* She doesn't have to become Miss Louisiana or something like it, but embrace her own individuality and her role within her family. The journey of the film is one of self-discovery, etc. This would matter less, except his claim is that the opening shot telegraphs the movie's theme--and the themes of *LMS* fly in the face of the inferences of the audience, which is the subversive goal of this opening shot.
- For *The Silence of the Lambs*, he claims that Clarice's Quantico training is the "middle of her journey" which just reveals that much of the symbolic analysis of this video is shorthand without much evidential support--after all, she's a novice agent who is still in training when she is pulled *out* of the program to interview Lecter. She will not accomplish agent status or complete her training until after the events of the film's climax.
- He claims she is "in a rut," which we see no evidence of (he claims her "rut" is that "she cannot save those who can't save themselves"--what that means within the context of the first shot, who could say), and claims that birds fluttering in the trees nearby are a symbol of freedom (again, first-order symbolic analysis and not inherently or apparently tied to the themes of the story).
- He similarly notes that the presence of a second rope "indicates not everybody has made it as far as she has" -- even though she has not yet completed her training, nor succeeded as an agent. Her isolation could *as easily* indicate that she is behind, that she must work harder to even keep up with the other candidates. We have no idea, because the film does not explicate this (though the book does, we're analyzing only opening shots of the films in this video).
- Finally, in general he makes the claims that "every great film has an equally great opening shot," and "Directors *always* make opening shots that contain so much in so little time." Obviously, these two universalizing statements are clearly and emphatically untrue.

I don't want to make this out like I think people such as Mr. Nugent *shouldn't be creating original criticism.* I appreciate the work he's attempting to do, but I'm interested in how the community can encourage essayists to do better, deeper, and more meaningful work. Additionally, I don't want to seem like I'm piling on Mr. Nugent in particular, or that I view the shortcomings of his videos (or this video specifically) as particularly egregious or worse than other video essays out there. I've selected his essay only because I feel it is very representative of a specific type and quality of work. However, I'm interested in how the trends of the video essay today are creating a space for this kind of shorthand analysis, along with the issues that come along with error-ridden analyses.

What we get, it seems, is often stylistically intriguing content which does not necessarily reflect the best practices of film criticism, and which often reads like freshman literary criticism (Freud, the phallus, birds are freedom, metonymic representation is always symbolically useful, etc.). In a lot of ways, the democratization offered by YouTube seems dangerous to me in this respect, because works by essayists making these foundational errors represent film criticism to many lay viewers, and could do some small amount of harm to the public's understanding of the value of film criticism and analysis. In general, I've noticed that as more people attempt to explore the video essay as a form of commentary, especially influenced by "celebrity" essayists like Tony Zhou, Lewis Bond, and Evan Puschak, there's been a trend to parrot their style of analysis without necessarily having the foundational background of someone like Zhou or Bond, or the practiced charisma of Puschak. I wonder to what degree these things go hand-in-hand.

(Editorial transparency: I actually don't like Puschak very much, but he's certainly doing something right commercially. It just bugs me that he substitutes talking more slowly at the end of his videos for actual analysis, presenting a false depth. Also, his post on *BvS*, while legitimate in its criticism, was intensely lazy in its "moments vs. scenes" argument, which was entirely hollow and pointless.).

So, I was hoping people who have been participating in the video essay community might want to use this space to talk about what they like, what's working, what's not, what trends we see developing, and what the future of the form might be. Who are you watching right now? What are they doing that you like? What would you like to see change?

As a final note, a lot of smaller channels *are* doing amazing, rigorous work. I'd highly recommend Michael Tucker at "Lessons from the Screenplay" for people interested in narrative and shot-planning structures and their influence on the medium. I've been enjoying Kristian Williams' historical and cultural contextualization of media (his [video on Godzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCTSSWT4lg) is just fantastic). And [r/Truefilm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Truefilm/)'s own Samuel Auer ([/u/samdabam](https://www.reddit.com/u/samdabam/)) recently produced an **incredible** visual analysis of *Nightcrawler.* [Everybody should watch it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShbjZMFhxk) I'm really looking forward to more work from him.

Anyhow, I appreciate your reading, and your thoughts and criticism!



71: I'm frankly more interested in the ones which show WHY a movie is good rather than the critique which is more possible to do in an essay via video than text.

Show me WHY Citizen Kane is significant with the specific examples and camera work and directing for example in a video essay and why it isn't boring cinema that I would assume it is without any context or film knowledge.

> 20: I agree that the best video essays address a **why** or **how** that goes into further depth - though I'm not sure the video essayist's goal should be to demonstrate that "a movie is good" as a value judgment. The failures of a film can be equally illuminating (along with other broader topics such as might be found across multiple films). Rather, I give preference to essays that understand and demonstrate some mechanism or choice which shapes the work(s) studied.
>
> I'm not sure I agree with (or maybe understand?) your argument about critique being more suited to textual than visual essays. Could you expand on that more? What do you see as the role of the video essayist as distinguished from the traditional essayist?
>
> > me: I like this..
> >
> > > 13: Regarding your last point, so when you're showing a video, you can point out exactly why this scene works so well or why this shot is so good. You can point out stuff that a person isn't gonna pick up if they aren't a film expert or you can show something X film is doing and something Y film also does slightly differently or just quickly use multiple films to show a certain technique or whatever. I have read some books and I can tell you it's dry as hell to read this in a book compared to seeing it on video. Being a visual learner basically to learn something visually based has its advantages.
> > >
> > > When we draw criticism, it's spread over multiple scenes if it's a criticism in style and it's easier to write about it via text if it's based on story as well. Whenever I've written a review (as an average film fan, I'm not an expert), it's been pretty easy for me to write what I didn't like about a film. It's a bit tougher to capture some of what I liked in words though beyond saying 'yeah it had nice cinematography'. Of course you can't show every positive in words, I can't show why I liked Frances Ha because of how peaceful it is in video, that's easier to state in text but in terms of showing technique, I think video's very fitting and I'm glad that video essays are starting to get going to show that even if many of them aren't very good or try hard to be pseudo-intellectual. Let's be honest, text based reviews have that same problem, they aren't perfect outside of certain reviewers.
> > >
> > > > me: so, this guy changed his mind :)
>
> 11: When making a video essay, use the advantage you have: talking about techniques employed and being able to show an example directly at the same time. It's not necessary for a good video, *Channel Criswell* rarely uses specific examples, but one of the reasons **Every Frame A Painting** is so popular is that Tony uitilizes the format he's in the best. He shows you everything he's talking about used in the film.

33: I just started making film-focused essays a couple months ago, and because of that I've been watching almost every essay I can find and thinking a lot about what makes for a good essay.

And here's my biggest observation, 90% of what makes a good video essay is in the writing, but it's only 50% of why you get noticed as an essayist. Because it has an audio-visual element it can be easier for poor writing to be obscured by a well produced video. A good essayist has to be two things, a good writer and a good video editor.

I understand your concern that the democratization of YouTube might be a danger, but I don't think you're exactly right. Written criticism has been democratized by the internet for a long time, and there are thousands of terrible "critics" online that go unnoticed. I think it's the nature of video essays as a medium that are allowing poorly written content to get a pass. You can be a good video editor and a mediocre writer and still get a decent amount of traction because there's so much demand for well produced video essays on YouTube. Lots of young people with extra time on their hands and access to editing software are looking at the fact that Puschak makes $3k per video on his Patreon and they're thinking "I can do that."

But I think it's changing, hopefully as there is more competition the essayists that are good editors but poor writers will either fade away or be forced to become better writers.

I think it's a young and exciting medium and I want to see it grow and become a respected format for criticism in general, but it's experiencing a lot of growing pains right now. But that's why it's great to be discussing it like this, and sharing and promoting the new up-and-comers that are worth watching, and helping the cream rise to the top.

Edit: OP asked us to link to our channels, so here's a [link to mine.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyvQV2JsICeLZP4c_h40kA) Hopefully I fall to the better side of the content that's out there. I'm trying.

> 19: From what I can gather, there are several things at least equally as important for a channel to become popular as the quality of its writing:
>
> - The length of the video. 5-10 minutes seem to be the sweet spot, although longer videos can be successful if the rest is up to a high standard.
> - The soundquality of the vocals. You must sound pleasant, both in the technical aspects (equipment, sound editing) and the sound of your voice itself.
> - The choice of topics. Well-known enough to attract a large crowd, but not too stale to be of no new information at all.
> - A fast-paced visual presentation and a good tempo of speech with enough pauses to breathe.
>
> No Small Parts is close to **Every Frame a Painting** in all those things, so his videos are almost as popular, although the actual insight of them trail miles behind Tony's. Nerdwriter and kaptainkristian have their strengths in the regularity of uploads, a wide array of popular topics and going just deep enough. Channel Criswell lacks the mass appeal in those attributes and makes longer videos, so he doesn't reach the view numbers of the aforementioned.

13: As someone currently in film school, and doing a video essay as a project, it's understandable the things you mentioned.

At the same time, the word essay is defined as "an attempt to try". So while some video essays are better than others, it is an individual interpretation, and not set it stone. Also, with comment sections and places like this, it allows for discourse and further understanding. The video essay is merely a stepping stone to help those interested in the subject matter to further their own synopsis and interpretation. The only people who truly understand everything about the films we talk about are the filmmakers themselves.

13 (luis.ferreira.azevedo from Beyond the Frame): Great! I really wanted to discuss this as well!

I understand your concerns for the quality of content negatively influencing an audience. I believe one of the good things about video-essays is that, not only at its best, but at its median, they promote visual literacy. They're a call to look a little closer, to understand how you're being "manipulated" (maybe not the right word). If you watch a video by Jack Nugent, you'll probably pay more attention to something he mentioned in one video and either agree or disagree. I think teaching people to look closer at movies is an overall positive consequence of video-essays, even if less-than perfect.

The quality of the criticism could hardly be at the level of a professional critic or an academic. Video-essayists are in average very young and don't have the benifit of an editorial team that polishes their work. That's a very different job description than a film critic's. They have a place to grow online and I'm pretty confident you'll see a few creators developing their chops as they go, in part because of an ongoing conversation with the people who follow them.

Then on the other spectrum you have academics making video-essays, which could be (and sometimes is) incredibly rich in content, but which suffer in style. I think if academics turned more towards the general public, and considered strategies to engage a more varied audience, they could improve the level of this movement. I don't think that's what they're interested in, which is a loss for cinephilia.

More than subpar quality, I worry more about your second issue: standardization. A lot of creators simply see the model of the more successful video-essayists and do a close approximation. The field is so vast and open to experimentation, that it is a shame that watched people who scratched the surface of what the video-essay can be, and and feel compelled to do the same.

> So, I was hoping people who have been participating in the video essay community might want to use this space to talk about what they like

For me [Kyle Kalgren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KaZd_ki4l2EUc1GY9u5Ew) is the best video-essayist working, right now. I love the work from a lot of people, Tony Zhou is incredible, Kogonada is the best editor among them all, Kevin B. Lee is the perfect link between the academic and the "mainstream", etc. But Kyle has consistently made very well-researched, opinionated, and humorous criticism through not only his writing, but his editing and performance.

His [video-essay on Holy Motors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYck3avMMDs) is my favourite video-essay. It is written with an excellent narrative arch, which is so well articulated. The theme is interesting, the analysis as well, and he comes to very poignant final considerations. I also like that he has a really small following, but is supported by a lot of people. That gives me hope for more obscure work to get supported by fans.

Disclaimer: I make video-essays [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7g7HfH1gWmhgxW47IcW7Q) and I've just finished writting a master thesis about them. I couldn't really write very many opinions there, so it feels good to let out like 5% of them!

> 3: Could you please name a few academics that make videos? I'm very interested in that content but don't know where to find it.
>
> > 7: Sure. A good place to start would be following [Catherine Grant](https://twitter.com/filmstudiesff) who, besides her work as an academic and video-essayist, has been doing a really great job curating video-essay work as well as other film resources on *Film Studies for Free* and [*Audiovisualcy*](https://twitter.com/audiovisualcy). You then have [[in\]Transition](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/intransition/), a peer reviewed publication for video-essay work.
> >
> > You can also look for individual video-essayists: Adrian Martin, Cristina Alvarez López, Drew Morton, Pasquale Ianone, Christian Keithley, Miklos Kiss, Chiara Grizzaffi, etc. There are a ton more, but they don't make new work very consistently. In the middle between the academics and the rest, there's Kevin B. Lee, who might be a good gateway.
>
> > 2: I named two very interesting ones (easier to source and very approachable) elsewhere in this thread you might check out: Thom Andersen, who made Los Angeles Plays Itself and Get in the Car, and William E. Jones, who has done a lot more aesthetic experiments, such as his VHS series.
> >
> > > > 3: I highly recommend starting with LAPI. It's just brilliant.

11: I'm personally very excited to see this genre of video grow and it'a apparent that many people enjoy this type of video. I see your concerns as valid but I think most film buffs will be able to sort the good from the bad and the average. For example, I'm not a huge fan of Nerdwriter1's videos- I find the analyses to be lacking depth and sometimes his assertions seem to be somewhat nonsensical.

On the other hand, my favorite channels for these essays are

[Channel Criswell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5kBJmBUVFLYBDiSiK1VDw)

[Every Frame A Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting)

[Darren- Must See Films](https://www.youtube.com/user/foleyd87/videos)

[Renegade Cut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9infsKo33_2LUoiqXGgQWg)

And [**LFTS**, obviously](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw)

There are probably a lot of good smaller channels I haven't seen but I've been enjoying these so far.

## What do you think is missing from most film analysis video essays today?

(2018) 107: With the rise of countless video essayists on YouTube trying to analyze films and different aspects of film, I think video essays (particularly film analysis) has become just a fancy new category of videos that you could make on the internet and thus, we're not getting to see any truly intelligent and well-written analyses. There was Tony from **Every Frame A Painting** who really seemed to know what he was talking about with his essays, but ever since he killed the project, it has all been just mediocre stuff building upon more mediocre stuff day by day imo (apart from some other channels like **Lessons From The Screenplay** & Nerdwriter1 who still make good content). What do you think is the reason for this? What was Tony doing right that these new essayists are not? What do you think is missing from most film analysis videos essays today and how can they be fixed?



106: Actual insight. Citations and references (!), comparable examples to other films in history, quotes from the filmmaker and film analysts, etc.

Basically, they have to prove and support their thesis through valid and sound arguments. Just because it's about film and it's in video format doesn't mean they get off of the hook.

> 54: yup, actual ideas and theses.
> most video essaysts are basically really good editors, with a great soothing radio voice, expressing their opinion with some writing frosting

> 25: [KyleKalgrenBHH](https://www.youtube.com/user/oancitizen/videos) and [Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/videos) already does this. even before **every frame of painting** do it.. they even have their own researcher now.

91: I'm not a fan of the medium but I have seen few that managed to hold me. The one thing I don't like with the videos on YouTube is that they often time completely lack subjectivity. There is a lot of emphasis on being objective and "right" which makes the content predictable and less interesting if the viewer is familiar with the subject beforehand. I think that the good ones also manages to strike a fine balance between visual and auditory information, and they often use the strengths of showing clips without VO to show what they actually mean. I'm not big on Nerdwriter but I've got to give cred to how well edited his videos are. He also animates to illustrate his points.

> 64: This really resonates with me; these video essayists all seem to use the same formula: focus on formal elements of the film and use them to present an objective “truth” about the film. This kind of formal analysis results in fairly dry and rather shallow exploration of the subject matter, albeit one that a lot of viewers derive some some small sense of satisfaction from knowing they now “understand” the film. It also feels like all these video essayists read the same articles from Wikipedia or Cracked, so there is a lot of repetition of the same limited material (try watching all the video essays on David Fincher to see a good example of how much regurgitation of the same material is out there).
>
> By contrast, I remember when I took a film class at university, one of the assigned reading materials was a Pauline Kael piece on Scorsese and Raging Bull. Kael’s reviews were always intensely personal and explored issues and emotions that existed outside the film but connected to it and created a critical context for what she was reviewing. In the review I read, there was a fascinating exploration of how Scorsese’s films seem chart a thematic orbit around his Catholic upbringing and the undercurrent of tension between trying to break free from that upbringing and the guilt he felt by turning his back on it.
>
> These video essayists really could learn a lot by reading Kael; I feel like the current glut of **Every Frame A Painting** copycats has reached a nadir. There is a space there for someone who can connect in video the way Kael could in prose; having said that, I doubt many of them could even if they tried.

53: An understanding of film-form and film history that can't be gleaned from 15 minutes on Wikipedia is something that kills a lot of these channels for me. Many film channels have essentially a layman's understanding of the medium so they stoop to pointing out "plot holes" and pepper in jargon (cinematography is a popular go-to) to lend credence to the essay.

Another thing that is also hurting the quality of critique is that many channels feel the need to maintain a consistent upload schedule. It's basically impossible to maintain quality and upload regularly. Nerdwriter1 suffers from this I think as he really feels like he's treading water in some videos but can't just shelve the project or he'd have nothing to upload.

There isn't really a simple fix for this and tbh why would there need to be? So many film essays/reviews on YouTube are unimaginably vapid but do amazing numbers and are well-received because their audience don't know any better (I promise I'm not trying to be an elitist). The only way this gets fixed is by content creators themselves taking an effort to understand the medium.

> 46: **Ellis** has a film academic background and it shows. She claims it's useless, but she clearly has a much better understanding of film history and entertainment criticism. Nobody else on YouTube has successfully pulled off a video about Marxism, and not even using one of the big guns in academia like Levi-Strauss or Durkheim.
>
> > 39: Yeah **Ellis**' videos are very good and 'The Whole Plate' series especially. Introducing her audience to 101 film theory with a series of videos on the Bayformers is both genius and hysterical.

30: My problem with video essays is just the fact that vast majority of them seem to have been made by <u>people with very shallow knowledge of film history</u>.

To put it bluntly, if you're not aware that there is more to cinema than just Fincher, Spielberg and PTA, then I'm simply not interested in your "analysis" regarding this art form.

26: Too much focus on plot or what is mistaken for story, while trying to "solve" the movie's plot whether it's "What I would do" or "I figured out the meaning of the ambiguity."

Movies are not a puzzles to be solved or plot=story. 

- They don't take 1. 
- The movies intent 2. 
- The context of film which the director is trying to make 3. 
- Actual dissection on the process of film making and why each shot is chosen 4. The emotions it's trying to convey and why it works/ doesn't work. 
- 5.let us know who the reviewer is and a sense of their taste.

It's irritating that a video says they are "objective" when they're really just a bunch of teenagers or teenagers in adult bodies trying to come off as smart.

> Me: I don't understand this comment at all :/

22: I think that, at least for me, what is missing from video essayists is a <u>strong sense of the theme of the film</u>. But another big note that seems to be missing for me is an awareness of the context to how much certain things they point out even matter. For instance I saw a video on Perfect Blue and there was a 5-10 minute part of how a conversation with her mother was in her head and then how scenes that are lit a certain way are of a certain state of mind. And while that's not useless information, the bigger picture of the film is the emotional core of the character, not simply that she is going through this mental breakdown but rather why she is and how she feels about it. I think there is a degree to which video essayists remain too "academic" and impractical. Sometimes an aspect of a film is simple supportive material and it's not worth poring over.

17: Every once in a while a thread like this will pop up in the sub and it never fails to be as shallow as the video essays it decries. I've read the majority of the comments and besides Grace Lee and Scout Tafoya, I've found no mention of a channel with less than 150.000 subscribers.

What's happening with video essays is that it's a format in expansion. This type of post would be the equivalent of wondering why film criticism became mediocre when blogs popped up and everyone got a platform. There's just a lot of crap out there. Most people watch a couple of newcomers and lose faith that new great voices are just around the corner, not giving them an opportunity to rise in the ranks as easily as someone like Tony Zhou did. Just look at the current front page of [r/videoessay](https://www.reddit.com/r/videoessay/). There's at least 5 or 6 video essays worth your time. Thomas Flight's breakdown of the use of translation and importance of language in Isle of Dogs, Must See Films pointed analysis of character dynamic in Phantom Thread, Entertain the Elk's rundown of the way the Coens end their films, or the first part of a series breaking down the theories of humor by... well... me. Scratch that one. Besides being great examples of why video essays don't suck, the other thing they have in common is less than 5 upvotes - in the sub dedicated to the format.

An interesting discussion would be how to separate the wheat from the gluten, instead of always going back to shitting on an entire format with just a handful of references and a disdain based on generalizations.

## Anyone else getting tired of amateur video essays?

893 (u/Adhiboy): I've noticed a lot of amateur video essayists popping up that seem to want to lecture me about a topic. The issue here is the word "amateur"; these so-called analyses of movies and television are often just the speaker going off on tangents about how great something is without providing sufficient evidence that backs them up.

I like YouTubers like **Every Frame A Painting** and KaptainKristian, who are a clear cut above the rest of the YouTubers I'm speaking about, but even their stuff comes off as "I'm right, just trust me" at times. Declarative statement upon declarative statement with evidence that doesn't always prove what's being said, yet people don't question it because it's presented nicely and their voices are soothing.

It sucks because they used to be something I enjoyed watching. Now, I can't even watch the "good" ones because everything seems so pretentious.

edit: here’s a good video that summarizes what I think:

https://youtu.be/rm00tSDlCG0

> Me: LOL, this video. Don't trust this guy's opinion

433: Have you heard of our lord and savior **Lindsay Ellis**?

> 115: Also, Kyle Kallgren, one of her collegues, is absolutely amazing, not only delving into film theory and history, but also the humanity of film. I think he doesn't get as much exposure because the movies he analyzes aren't as mainstream. I suggest his analysis of "This is Not a Film." For something a little more well-known, he also reviewed "Cloud Atlas."
>
> Edit: Grammer

> 90: Also Folding Ideas, who also knows her.

> 77: [YFW you find someone for your spinoff show making more money and better content than you while also trashing your entire business](https://mlpforums.com/uploads/post_images/img-2282329-1-nostalgia-critic-headbang-o.gif)
>
> > 65: Genuine question: Is she actually making more than the Nostalgia Critic at this point? I know she's got about 4K patreons, but I know that the Critic has sponsorship out the ass and a much larger platform.
> >
> > > 127: *TL;DR I don't think so, I think their sponsored content is out of desperation now that the Indiegogo funds ran out.*

218: Yeah, I'm sick of word essays. Especially since most of them don't delve beyond "Blade Runner 2049 is really good and I like it." Theres so many interesting cinema topics to talk about, yet every video essay is about "Mad Max: Fury Road" or "John Wick"

> 64: I agree, I really like video essays but a lot of them seem to cover the same topics. I would like to see more essays tackle classics or even just random movies. That's what I love about CineFix, they always get me wanting to see a movie I've never heard of. But I would also love to see more diverse in-depth analysis. There are a lot of movies worthy of one, but they came out before the video essay trend.
>
> > 140: I can promise you there's a very strong reason that essayists don't cover more classics or random films, *no one watches them*. It's already still an incredibly niche genre, the most successful of whom is Nerdwriter at what, 2.5 million? That's a fraction of the top gaming or beauty or vlog channels, and the competition is getting more and more fierce all the time. It almost seems like there are more people making these types of videos than watching them at this point.
> >
> > These videos take an insane amount of time to produce compared to the regular content people churn out on YouTube, and with ad revenue being abysmal, the only way to make any sort of real impact, or money for that matter, is to cover well known topics.
> >
> > For example, I made a video about Baby Driver, it's at almost 500k views. Eternal Sunshine, almost 100k. I talk about Kingdom of Heaven and its substantially better Director's Cut in a 17 minute in-depth examination of what's different about both films and why the DC is so much better, 12k.
> >
> > Or a buddy of mine Charlie runs a channel called 100 Years of Cinema, where he picks a different iconic film from each year of the last century and discusses different angles of how the influenced the industry or were landmarks of their time in general and he's lucky to break 10k with each video.
> >
> > So long story short, it's an incredibly competitive genre that still is incredibly obscure on the internet, is also in a total wave of critiques(like this OP and video linked and the dozen other carbon copies of the same exact complaints) with very little ad revenue, people shitting on you for taking sponsorships or linking to a Patreon page, all for videos that take dozens or hundreds of hours to produce. It's one of the more unforgiving genres to create within in an already crowded and unforgiving platform to begin with.

97: Yep. For every good one like Kaptain Kristian or Lindsay Ellis there are 10 shitty ones who drone on and on with vacuous word salads cough nerdwriter1 cough

> 56: I disagree heavily on kaptin Kristin. He possibly they least "evidence based" video essays of any of the popular essayist. He just seems to say "this popular thing is good" over and over in slightly different ways while showing clips until the video is over, unlike other essayists which actually go into film theory or get quotes from people involved.

78: I'm gonna be honest, the video you posted that you say summarizes how you feel kind of gives off that "trust me, I'm right" vibe immediately with the little cutouts of a dude's avatar giving some cool guy poses.

Is that the point of it? It's kind of hard to want to watch it, tbh.

60: I'm not, I like hearing other people's opinions and think it's great that more and more people are expressing what they believe, and interpret in films.

57: I agree. A lot of them come off as pretentious and “fake deep”. They just make some aesthetic thumbnail and then talk with a really calming and “intelligent” voice. When in reality what they’re talking about is pretty surface level. I stopped watching Nerdwriter1 and Bobby Burns once I realized this.

51: My problem with most of these Nerdwriter knockoffs is that they are "analyzing" mediocre Marvel films and it just comes off incredibly pretentious to me
