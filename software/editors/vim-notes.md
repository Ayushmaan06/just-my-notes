## Clipboard

> [Source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12535/how-to-copy-text-from-vim-to-an-external-program)

The following will work only if vim --version indicates that you have +xterm_clipboard feature. If not, you will have to install extra packages or recompile vim with that feature added. - USE GVIM

"+y - copies to the "usual" clipboard buffer (so you can paste using Ctrl+V, right click and select "Paste" etc)
"*y - copies to the X11 selection - you can paste from this buffer using middle click.

Note that "* and "+ work both ways. So if you have selected some text in another application, you can paste it into vim using "*p and if you have copied some text (using, say, Ctrl-C) then you can paste it into vim using "+p.

## Neovim

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

Sharing configs btw vim & neovim:

> [Source](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/12794/how-to-share-config-between-vim-and-neovim)

- use existing ~/.vimrc and plugins located within ~/.vim without having to symlink the files
- add the following lines to ~/.config/nvim/init.vim:

```
set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
let &packpath=&runtimepath
source ~/.vimrc
```

[Goneovim](https://github.com/akiyosi/goneovim) is a GUI frontend for neovim. It is written in Go, using a Qt binding for Go.

Neovim (and even Vim) has been optimized for working with Terminal, and some Terminal-based workflows cannot be achieved with a GUI. Therefore, for some people, a GUI would be an unnecessary additional stuff. On the other hand, in my opinion, there are some attractive features of GUI as follows.

  - More meta keys can be used
     - Since Neovim performs all of its operations with the keyboard, having more meta keys available is a simple advantage.
  - Terminal is also available in Neovim GUI
     - Neovim has an embedded terminal emulator that can be run in :terminal, so you can run basic terminal workflows using :terminal with bash or zsh in Neovim GUI. It is also possible to use remote control tools such as nvr to avoid nvim in nvim in Neovim GUI.
  - Experience the rich drawing expressions of GUI
     - For example, it is possible to scroll based on pixels, to set different font families and point sizes for each window.
