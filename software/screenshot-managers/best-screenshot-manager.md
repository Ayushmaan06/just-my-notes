# Best screenshot managers

Scrot

Maim. It is easy to use and nicely scriptable.

Flameshot rocks! It's not just a screenshot tool. You can do some simple modifications like add some marks, arrow heads, texts, and circles or rectangles which are very common used to emphasize something in a picture. You can also put things in a blur or mosaic to hide personal information in a screenshot. And finally my personal favorite, the pin function. You can pin screenshots on the screen on top of everything else. I found this really useful when I am reading papers and there are always figures and tables that are on different pages from the texts. Pin the figures and tables is really handy.

> I think is a fast app, faster than Shutter. However, I couldn't find the place where my screenshots are.

Spectacle

Shutter 

> I was using it but I am tired( It's so slow.... It has a nice editing feature which allows you to edit your screenshots. There were news that development of this app will continue.
