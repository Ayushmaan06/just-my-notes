On the other hand, open source free projects that are not included on **Steam** are either way going to be Linux native, so this. But if some devs want a better playerbase, they would either how rather focus on WindowsOS build, possibly finding Linux unrewarding.

Idealism? <u>Valve created Steam on Linux because they feared losing their dominance to the Windows Store</u>. They created a way that they would have control over the environment to maintain market dominance if the gambit was successful. It was about SteamOS, not Linux.
As Microsoft didn't restrict Windows users to only installing software through the Windows Store, nothing has changed. The Steam Machine was a bust. Steam OS is smoke. Valve still require games to have a Windows version to list in Steam, even if it's the only version.

Valve don't give a rat's about free-software. Altruism is not their motivation.
