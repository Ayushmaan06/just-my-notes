  > The very same approach that scientists use to understand the natural world  is effective for studying the running time of programs:
  >
  > - *Observe* some feature of the  natural world, generally with precise measurements.
  > - *Hypothesize* a model that is consistent with the observations.
  > - *Predict* events using the hypothesis.
  > - *Verify* the predictions by making further observations.
  > - *Validate* by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.
  >
  > The experiments we design must be *reproducible* and the hypotheses that we formulate must be *falsifiable*.

  > The total running time of a program is determined by two primary factors: the cost of executing each statement and  the frequency of execution of each statement.
