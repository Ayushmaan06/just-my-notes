I am going to assume that a lot of people just hate poem analysis and therefore support anything against them. However, analysis isn’t about extracting the „right“ information, it’s about extracting reasonable theories. For example „The curtain were blue“ is obviously different than „The curtains were shining in a bright green“. So in the right context there is room for interpretation.  Of course you should never overinterpret tiny pieces of movies/Text but analysis really isn’t about crazy ideas you have, it’s more about what can you use to proof your theories on how the movie/Text influences its watchers/readers.
