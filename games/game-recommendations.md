## Fightings

Here are the best fightings according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/8aodlb/best_fighting_games_of_all_time/):

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 (the worst is 1, the 3rd one is slightly bad than the 2nd one). Street Fighter Alpha II is a different series than the Street Fighter II games. The Alpha series is quite good and a lot more varied than SF2 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/61wbxe/best_version_of_sfii/).

  > SF 2 is the most important game in the series and is the mort important game in the genre. Nonetheless, people say Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the best in the series.

- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is the best version of Street Fighter 2 (nonetheless, some people say that ST 2: Turbo is better than Super Turbo - e.g. audio). The best ways to play this game are through Hyper Street Fighter 2 for PS 2, Ultra SFII for the Switch, and the 30th Anniversary Collection for PS 3 and XBOX 360 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7r0n54/what_is_the_difference_between_all_the_street/).

- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the most hyped game in the series.

- What about modern SF? Ultra Street Figher lV is the most balanced because of patches. Nonetheless, SF V is more alive game than USF4.

- Tekken 3.

- Soulcalibur 2.

## Role-playing games

### The Legend of Zelda

Here are the best The Legend of Zelda games:

- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time. The best way to play this game is through Nintendo 3DS. You can use Citra emulator in order to do this but it isn't that stable. Nonetheless, people say that OoT runs well on this emulator. The other way to play this game is to use the latest Project64 with the [GLideN64](http://www.emucr.com/2016/10/gliden64-git-20161016.html) plugin upscaled and played with true unstretched [widescreen](http://i.imgur.com/EEe7Wrx.jpg), it also supports high res textures [[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/5ajs18/best_way_to_play_emulated_ocarina_of_time_in_2016/?sort=top)].
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

### Pokemon

After googling I find out that the best Pokémon games (for me) are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region (the first region - classic):

- Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen versions - are the enhanced remakes to the original Japanese Pokémon games (Red and Green) for the Game Boy Advance. While Fire Red was a remake of Pokémon Red, LeafGreen was a remake of the Japan-only Pokémon Green. Pokémon Green had previously been a Japan exclusive, being replaced by Pokémon Blue in the US. Regardless, the Green remake was chosen for the US editions [[WIKI]([https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pokémon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen))]. Yeah, this is hard!!! :laughing:

Other great Pokémon games are Pokémon HeartGold/ SoulSilver.

## Metroidvania

### Metroid

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1rwsx8/how_would_you_rank_the_games_best_to_worst/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/9gcby0/what_are_your_top_5_metroid_games/):

- Metroid: Prime (some people say that Prime 2 is better than the first one because it is more polished).
- Super Metroid.

## Platforms

## Mario

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6a080g/super_mario_games_what_are_your_alltime_rankings/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7y3sjd/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mario_game_and_why/?sort=top) :

- Super Mario World is still the best among the 2D games.
- Super Mario Bros. 3.
- Super Mario 64 - It was a super creative transition into 3D gaming.
- The others would be Galaxy 1 and 2 (the second is slightly better than the first one but both are the best among 3D), classic Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Odyssey.
