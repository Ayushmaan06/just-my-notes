## Action-adventures

### Tomb Raider

The best Tomb Raider games according to [Reddit 1](reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/bew13k/whats_your_favoriteleast_favorite_tomb_raider_game/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/52ng6r/by_far_what_is_your_favorite_tomb_raider_game/), [Reddit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/7uh7lb/best_tomb_raider_game_you_guys_played/?sort=top), [Reddit 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/454yvi/the_old_tomb_raider_games_are_really_amazing/):

- Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II: Starring Lara Croft are the best in the Original Timeline and the best in the whole franchise.
- Tomb Raider: Legend is the best one in the Legend Timeline (I wouldn't say it after the StopGame streams). Also, people say that Tomb Raider: Anniversary is great too.
- Rise of the Tomb Raider is the best game in the Survivor Timeline, it is like a perfect mix of action and puzzles. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is good, but in terms of puzzles. Tomb Raider is an action based game.

## Fightings

Here are the best fightings according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/8aodlb/best_fighting_games_of_all_time/):

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 (the worst is 1, the 3rd one is slightly bad than the 2nd one). Street Fighter Alpha II is a different series than the Street Fighter II games. The Alpha series is quite good and a lot more varied than SF2 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/61wbxe/best_version_of_sfii/).

  > SF 2 is the most important game in the series and is the mort important game in the genre. Nonetheless, people say Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the best in the series.

- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is the best version of Street Fighter 2 (nonetheless, some people say that ST 2: Turbo is better than Super Turbo - e.g. audio). The best ways to play this game are through Hyper Street Fighter 2 for PS 2, Ultra SFII for the Switch, and the 30th Anniversary Collection for PS 3 and XBOX 360 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7r0n54/what_is_the_difference_between_all_the_street/).

- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the most hyped game in the series.

- What about modern SF? Ultra Street Figher lV is the most balanced because of patches. Nonetheless, SF V is more alive game than USF4.

- X-Men Children of the Atom was very innovative, gave birth to the Marvel / Capcom games which not only popularized the tag system and the crossovers, but also created a new genre with exaggerated super powers, high jumps and easy combos which we will later see in games like Guilty Gear and similar. Marvel vs Capcom 2: probably the best MvC ever made. Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 if we want modern version.

- Tekken 3 is the best fighting of PS One epoch, Tekken 7 is currently the best in the series in terms of the gameplay and the novelty. Also, Tekken 7 is the best fighting to get into online.

- Dragon Ball series: 

  - FighterZ is objectively the best fighting game because it's designed to actually be competitive and the art/animation is freaking beautiful, but they focused more on competitive online multiplayer instead of a lengthy storymode full of unlockable characters.
  - Budokai 3 and then Tenkaichi 3. Budokai 3 was great for fast action and feeling like a very DBZish fighting game, also had a good amount of unlockables and the story stuff was quite neat because of hsow you could go back and play through it again while making changes that would lead to fighting folks like Broly or so on. Tenkaichi 3 was good primarily because of its roster size which was unrivaled at the time, not to mention characters had transformations/etc. that could be pulled off mid-match (and most of the Saiyans could transform into Great Ape forms if there was a full moon on that stage). Tenkaichi 3 has the downside in copy-paste of the many characters.

  > If you're looking for strictly a fighting game, FighterZ wins hands down. Budokai 3 is superior though if you aren't looking to play online competitive multiplayer and want to dig through story content with a lot of things to unlock.

- Soulcalibur 2.

- Mortal Kombat series according to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/ap39oc/whats_your_favourite_mortal_kombat_game/?sort=top) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/72wjg9/rank_every_mk_game/?sort=top):

  - the best is 9 (sometimes MK 11 or just MK).
  - Mortal Kombat Deception (and then Armageddon). I tried this game. It's fun, but you need to grind too much to get cool items. Although, these items could be arts or photos which is strange. This one has cool modes among among which there is Tetris, and also  The Konquest Mode, which people like.
  - MK3/UMK3/MKT - best original game.
  - MK 2.
  - MKX. Mind blowing graphics, a top notch story and awesome new characters, but those in game purchases...

- The others would be Super Smash Brother Melee and Super Smash Bros 64 (according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/459z3g/what_is_the_best_fighting_game_ever/?sort=top).

## Hack 'n' Slash (character action games)

- Devil May Cry:

  > But 1, 3, and 5 are all masterpieces. 4 is just another solid game in comparison.

  - DMC5: Mechanically the best game in the series.
  - DMC3 (with 2): was genre defining, had the best story, perfect representation of the series.
  - DMC1: literally create a genre (Character action games or, to be more precise, Character Hack 'n' Slash games).
  - DMC4 - Aged better in terms of story and gameplay. Hated the fact it was rushed. 3 to 4 added onto the incredible combat and made it even more nuts. Some players over rate 4 because it was their first and that makes total and complete sense. But it has never been the best. Middle of the road game. And that's still a good thing because the DMC series is generally great.
  - DmC - Gameplay wise it's extremely fun, it just bastardizes everything else.
  - DMC2 - Ehhhh.

- Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.

- NieR:Automata.

- Ninja Gaiden Black + 2.

- Onimusha (PS2) series isn't 'pure' hack-and-slash but still has some cool melee stuff going on (and moreso as the series progressed).

- Bayonetta 2. It's just so well put together and satisfying to play.

## Immersive Sims

Many things were taken from this [source](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313302/7_influential_immersive_sims_that_all_devs_should_play.php):

- System Shock 2 - an RPG-influenced, twisted horror playground. The systems-heavy interactivity and freedom at the core of immersive sims can just as easily be used to stifle and undermine as to liberate and empower, if paired with smart writing.
- Thief 1 & 2 - narrow-but-deep expression of the genre. Less is often more in game design; by focusing on a smaller set of ideas, systems, and verbs, Thief establishes a world dripping with detail and carefully designed around physicality — space, sound, light, dark, and movement bring depth to its relatively simple set of mechanics.
- Deus Ex - broad ambition, flexible systems, and varying situations. Consistency does not mean always offering a full suite of options, or even necessarily allowing the same solutions to always work; rather, it's in following the rules of the world, and if you're smart about it it could involve setting expectations that experimentation will be rewarded more so than rote behavior.
- Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines - a flawed but brilliant study of power fantasies. Artful use of scripting can configure and reconfigure player expectations, even in games that prize player freedom and emergence.
- Pathologic (I don't think it's an Immersive Sim).
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
- Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.
- Dishonored 1 & 2 - seamless possibility spaces meet masterful world building. Giving players full agency to play how they want takes two key design considerations: on the one hand, a diverse, inventive suite of tools and verbs, and on the other smart level design that allows freedom to solve problems in any way the player can imagine.
- The Long Dark.
- Prey.
- Arx Fatalis - an immersive RPG. The beating heart of an immersive sim is its world — make that feel tangible and rewarding to simply exist in and you'll have achieved much of the central ideal of the genre: the sense of immersion in one's virtual surroundings.
- Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
- My Summer Car - the future of immersive sims. Immersive sims don't need to have sci fi or fantasy themes; they can be set just as easily in the life of an unextraordinary person in decidedly ordinary circumstances.

Some other games have Immersive Sim components too: Hitman Blood Money (with 1st person), Metal Gear Solid V (with its AI system), Fallout New Vegas (with its 1st person view and hardcore mode), Second DLC of Bioshock Infinite, TES Morrowind (occasionally).

> An immersive sim can be anything so long as it's consistent and reactive and its world feels alive.

## Metroidvania

### Castelvania

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/96ldav/what_are_the_essential_castlevania_games_that_i/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/8ehgo1/what_are_your_personal_top_10_castlevania_games/):

- Castlevania 4: Symphony of the Night - revived the series and spawned a new genre known as Metroidvania games. Players assume the role of Alucard, as you explore Dracula’s Castle in order to find and defeat him. No longer are whips the weapon of choice, as swords and shields have taken over, along with magic and and the ability to transform into mist, wolves and bats. Explore the beautifully-detailed non-linear castle – right side up or inverted.
- Rondo of Blood - probably the best game in the entire series
- Aria of Sorrow - one of the best stories and gameplay.

### Metroid

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1rwsx8/how_would_you_rank_the_games_best_to_worst/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/9gcby0/what_are_your_top_5_metroid_games/):

- Super Metroid.
- Metroid: Prime (some people say that Prime 2 is better than the first one because it is more polished).

## Platforms

### Donkey Kong

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6vcx5r/whats_your_favorite_donkey_kong_game_from_the/):

- Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.
- Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.

### Mario

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6a080g/super_mario_games_what_are_your_alltime_rankings/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7y3sjd/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mario_game_and_why/?sort=top):

- Super Mario World is still the best among the 2D games.
- Super Mario Bros. 3.
- Super Mario 64 - It was a super creative transition into 3D gaming.
- The others would be Galaxy 1 and 2 (the second is slightly better than the first one but both are the best among 3D), classic Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Odyssey.

### Mega Man

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9l4jgs/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_in_2018/?sort=top), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/9mlkkp/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_out_of_the_entire/?sort=top), [Reddit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/aahasi/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mega_man_game/), and [Reddit 4](reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/8tlvvq/is_it_worth_playing_every_megaman_game/?sort=top):

>Most of the series is pretty redundant. I’d say start at Mega Man 2, 7, X and X4.

- **Mega Man 2** and Mega Man 3 are wildly considered the best of the original series (especially 2). I tried them and must admit that they have annoying backgrounds. Don't pick 3 to start with. It's a good game but it's Incredibly hard and Longer than the other classic games. Also among them, people still distinguish Mega Man 7 (how many of them :().

- **Mega Man X** is the best of the X series. The original Mega Man X was remade on the PlayStation Portable as Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X. On December 21, 2011, another remake of Mega Man X was released for download on the iPhone and iPad. X2 and X4 are good too, but someone thinks X4 is *the* best in that series and in the franchise as a whole.

  > If you like X, then I highly recomment X2 - 4 as well (4 has some terrible voice work, but also some fantastic gameplay.)

- Mega Man Zero is the hardest Mega Man series, the gameplay is similar to X but more fast and fluid, it has a very interesting plot and a conclusion, the music is top tier. 1 and 2 are especially worth it. Mega Man Zero 3 for story. 

### Sonic

Classic:

- Sonic the Hedgehog 1
- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - Sega’s answer to Mario, Sonic arrive to to carry the Genesis brand name. While the original Sonic and its second sequel, Sonic 3, were fantastic games in their own right, the blue Hedgehog’s best adventure was his second go-around. Dazzling speed with beautifully rich and colourful levels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 pits the titular character and his companion Tails against the evil Dr. Robotnik. Make sure to collect enough rings to enter the special stages, allowing you to transform into Super Sonic.

## Role-playing games

### Chrono Trigger

Mixing epic RPG action and time travel, Chrono Trigger is one of the best and most popular games on the SNES as well as one of the greatest RPG’s of all time. With a complex story revolving around your group of heroes jumping from one time period to the next trying to stop the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger presented amazing aesthetics, a fantastic musical score, endearing characters, an innovative battle system, multiple endings and even a major character’s death – we won’t say who, but it was unheard of at the time.

### Ni no Kuni

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

- Ni no Kuni 1 - the art style is by Studio Ghibli and it is an awesome RPG with some Pokémon like aspects too where you collect and evolve familiars.
- Ni no Kuni 2 is less cool than the first but it has more abilities to build your army.

### The Legend of Zelda

Here are the best The Legend of Zelda games:

- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time. The best way to play this game is through Nintendo 3DS. You can use Citra emulator in order to do this but it isn't that stable. Nonetheless, people say that OoT runs well on this emulator. The other way to play this game is to use the latest Project64 with the [GLideN64](http://www.emucr.com/2016/10/gliden64-git-20161016.html) plugin upscaled and played with true unstretched [widescreen](http://i.imgur.com/EEe7Wrx.jpg), it also supports high res textures [[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/5ajs18/best_way_to_play_emulated_ocarina_of_time_in_2016/?sort=top)].
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The biggest flaw of Majora's Mask is that the game has to be played on time.
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is the best game for Switch.
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

Also, A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening are awesome. 

>  Link's Awakening was recommended by Frankie Ward. I think she played its remake on Switch.

### Persona

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/9mbj87/whats_the_general_consensus_on_best_persona_game/):

- Persona 3 - 5 and 3 are a tie. The story of 3 is better, thematically strong, good characters who all get a fair amount of screen time. Persona 5 is a better **game** but not worth replaying. Persona 3 FES is honestly better than PSP version. 
  P3P has the Female MC option to give you something new to do if you're already done all the social links with the Male MC. Battling is better in P3P since you can control all your party members. Outside battles and dungeons P3P is more of a visual novel style. You don't run around town, you just move a cursor. P3P doesn't have the animated cutscenes. P3P doesn't have the Answer included with it like FES does, but the Answer is boring anyway. The best way to experience it is through youtube for some story-line closure. The best way to play is with P3P while watching the animated cutscenes on youtube.
- Persona 5 and Persona 2. 5 has the worst story but amazing gameplay and characters though they don't get any worthwhile development. Overall, the game is solid tho. 2 has meh gameplay but that story. And all the characters are amazing too.

### Pokemon

After googling I find out that the best Pokémon games (for me) are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region (the first region - classic):

- Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen versions - are the enhanced remakes to the original Japanese Pokémon games (Red and Green) for the Game Boy Advance. While Fire Red was a remake of Pokémon Red, LeafGreen was a remake of the Japan-only Pokémon Green. Pokémon Green had previously been a Japan exclusive, being replaced by Pokémon Blue in the US. Regardless, the Green remake was chosen for the US editions [[WIKI]([https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pokémon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen))]. Yeah, this is hard!!! :laughing:
- Other great Pokémon games are Pokémon HeartGold/ SoulSilver.

## Strategies

- Heroes of Might & Magic 3.

- Anno 1404 and then Anno 2070 (feels like an ultra-polished version of 1404). Nice comments are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/andnkq/how_would_you_rank_all_the_anno_games_and_why/). Some people say that Anno 1800 is actually pretty good and can be a nice modern Anno experience.

- Civilization 4 (maybe with DLC, maybe without them.) and then Civilization 5 (with expansions!) - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/35wfzm/what_are_your_top_5_strategy_games_of_all_time/).

- Age of Empires 2.

- Rome: Total War and then Medieval II: Total War.

- World in Conflict. 

  > This is one of the few games I kept playing for its story. It assumes that the cold war got hot and the Soviet Union invaded the USA. At first this sounds kinda cliché and dull imo, but it was very well presented and actually thrilling to see how things unfold.

- Command & Conquer: Red Alert and Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn.

- Starcraft 1-2. Some people say Warcraft (especially the 3rd one) > Starcraft.

- Age of Mythology - my own first strategy video game <3

Also Settlers were great! Settlers 2 and 3 were the best in the series. 4 is the best game if we want more modern gameplay.

### Paradox games

> Trying to rank. Sources: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/m470ce/how_would_you_rank_all_the_major_paradox_games/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/gtthvz/how_do_you_rank_the_paradox_games/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/jvzazg/what_is_the_best_paradox_game_in_your_opinion/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/lazz7o/what_is_your_favorite_paradox_game/).

1. Victoria 2

   - Has the depth and the best mechanics.

   - Dynamic trading.

   - The population dynamics is amazing.

   - Tight pacing. 100 years is such a good length, every action feels meaningful.

   - Will taught you about economy and modern politics. Probably it has the best economy simulations.

   - Fantastic experience with DLCs (A House Divided and Heart of Darkness) and mod (**Historical Project Mod (HPM)**).

   - It's a lot easier to blob in EU4 but playing tall there is kinda boring. In Vic2 it's hard to blob but the internal management is good.

   - Industry can work on its own, but the AI is extremely dumb and builds horrible factories. It can be tweaked endlessly by the player.

   - Vic2 has a lot of potential for strategic depth that isn't really necessary in casual singleplayer most of the time, but nonetheless is there if you need to optimize for particular challenges.

   - Good if you are playing a minor/unciv and want to rise to greatness.

   - In EU4 (unless you have MEIOU), the economy is very fixed and never changes or develops whereas in Vicky you can actually contribute to development without abstract PowerPoints and do fun things.

     > I think not even paradox fully understands how the economy in vicky  works, and honestly in a lot of ways its a bit of a mess (just watch the game explode when China westernizes)

   > Good review of Vic 2 on Steam by Supr:
   >
   > > If you get this game, get all the dlc (A house divided and heart of darkness), and if you do that, download the Historical Project Mod (HPM). It's only 2 dlc, and it's fairly cheap.
   > >
   > > If you're coming from another pdx game and you find this game tough to get into, a couple tips.
   > >
   > > 1. Every pdx game has sort of a core focus. Eu focuses on map painting, hoi focuses on tactical combat, ck focuses on kingdom management within feudalism. In Vic, you focus on pops and economy. So if it's stressing you out that you're not constantly warring like in eu4, that's perfectly fine.
   > > 2. A few fundamental truths about the game. This is set during a period of rapid industrialization. This means...
   > >    - You want your farmers and labourers (people who work the land) to become craftsmen (people who work in factories). Get technology that makes your farms/mines more efficient, and encourage people to join your factories.
   > >    - This means artisans (people who make specialized goods prior to industrialization generally speaking) will occasionally starve to death. Don't worry, this is normal. ♥♥♥♥ the poor
   > >    - Capitalists are retarded and have no concept of supply chains or making use of your RGOs (a good the province produces), so build your own factories early on, and match them with corresponding RGOs and create supply chains within the same state. After your core economy is established, it's not as important to build anymore (save for new techs). To do this, you need a government that allows you to build factories (State Capitalism)
   > >    - One slightly less intuitive thing about this game is that being really successful doesn't correlate quite as strongly with how big your country looks on a map compared to other pdx titles. You want prestige, industry score and military score, so things like literacy rates, technology, population density, good raw materials like iron/coal are more useful than blobbing if you want to become stronk.
   > >    - If your factory isn't getting a critical resource, there's a very good chance that its in very high demand on the world market. Check the trade screen and connect the dots.
   > >    - Everything is incentive based in this game. In eu4 and ck3, you can just conscript people into your army at the drop of a dime if you have the money. In vic2, you need to convince people that joining the army is worthwhile, so drag that slider up!
   > >
   > > Hope these tips help.

   > Vicky 2 has stuff going for it that  no other game has been able to capture. Pops, production, the economy,  colonization, and sphering are so well done. The game is definitely  dated af but man, the good parts are amazing. Games like EU4 have  policies and edicts, etc. that you can enact but all they do is give  multipliers and bonuses here or there. Everything is very abstracted,  which is okay because it's a video game,, but still. Converting culture? Spend this abstract resource to commit genocide, raise autonomy, and  wham, youre done in a few months. Same with conversions. Compare that  with Vicky 2. Pops can assimilate to your primary culture, but are way  more likely to do that if they're happy. You can neglect nonaccepted  pops and they will die/move away. Itll take a while and in the meantime  they'll rise up in revolt. Theres no button you can press, no resource  you can spend to make the problem just go away. Pops are persistent  entities in the game with individual ideological alignments, wealth, and needs. Nothing you can do will directly solve their problems. You can  enact social policies or sphere a country with access to a resource that that pop needs, and they'll grow slowly happy and complacent over time. Of course, that's only if they feel accepted. You're gonna get revolts  if you're conservative or reactionary, as you should! In HOI4, it doesnt mstter than you're carrying out Generalplan Ost. You just get a  negative modifier that damages some factories, etc. Sure, you need to  deal with it, but you don't really feel connected with the people of  your nation that way. Victoria II is the exact opposite. Another way  it's nonabstracted: Providing socialized medical care increases  population growth exponentially, and each pop is an actual person (or  1000 adult males), rather than just a number. If they get what they  need, they'll be happy. If they can't, they might die, or worse, become  anarcho-capitalists. Another way: If you're playing with a planned  economy, your struggles can cause the death of millions, but it also  gives you way more control, which is crucial because AI is AI. That  actually reflects how planned economies work IRL. And laissez-faire  capitalism has the same benefits and drawbacks that it does in reality.  Your government isn't on the hook for foreseeing every future need, but  you're kinda screwed in a crisis, you can't plan ahead as much, and, oh  yeah, capitalist fuccbois don't GAF if people are starving as long as  they can make a profit. Another way: playing tall is actually how the  game is meant to be played. If you're constantly blobbing and under  siege, then your pops will die and your nafion will seriously suffer as a result. Since pops grow exponentially and they produce literally  everything in the game, losing a few thousand early on means millions  fewer births down the line. In eu4, getting sacked just means that you  have a red bar to deal with that goes away after a while or after you  click a button a few times. Another way: Access to specific resources  means life and death for your nation. In eu4 and ck2, you have generic  trade. It rarely matters what good you're trading in as long as you get  cash at the end of the day. It's the exact opposite for Vicky 2. If you  don't have rubber, you can't produce cars and tanks enough for it to  have any impact. Factories will close down, people will lose to their  jobs and take to the streets. It makes fighting over one tiny province  in the middle of nowhere way more significant than just painting the map your color.
   >
   > What I'm trying to  say is that Vicky 2 feels like running a government and leading a nation rather than playing a game in the best way possible. Sometimes, that  can be fucking tedious, but for lots of us, we don't care. That  historical realism is what keeps me coming back. Most history games use  classic top-down conceptions of history that ignore 99% of the  population. Everything is armies, the state, government, and the church. That's fine, it makes for great strategy games. I fucking love CK2 and  EU4, and both are very top-down games. But the last 100 years of  historiography have seen history, political theory and anthropology  expand greatly and start to prize the experiences and agency of the  little people of the world, which, of course, is a group we all belong  to. I think it's really cool that a game like Victoria II exists that  reflects that. Victoria II is was so daring and inventive and still  stands out for that very reason. It definitely has a million problems  and looks like shit, don't get me wrong. But the great things about it  can shine through if you give it a chance. I don't blame anyone that  doesn't agree or just cant get into it, though. Try playing as Brazil or Persia or Japan, or even a nation like the Two Sicilies. You wont be  able to just annex the factories and provinces you need unless you're a  God gamer, and then the satisfaction of building up a strong economy and workforce really shines through.

   > VIC2 (17) - oh how it pains me to put it second. This has the potential to not only be better than CK2/3, but by *a lot*. It spans, personally, the most interesting period of history, and its  mechanics are more than capable of being the best in the diplomatic,  economic and demographic aspects of grand strategy. But it’s also old,  older than CK2. And it had a lot less love, while at the same time being far more complicated. It is a broken game, and the only reason why it’s in second place is because it has gained an extremely affectionate  community who has developed game-changing mods of the calibre of HPM and HFM. You also need to play it with both DLCs, otherwise the game is  just unplayable. All considered, if and when VIC3 will be developed, it  will definitely have the potential to be *the best* Paradox game, but as of now, VIC2 is a bit of a wreck, though still extremely enjoyable.

2. Europa Universalis 4

   - The most playable and addictive.
   - Lots of content and refinement.
   - Best diplomacy of all games.
   - Teaches a  lot about the history (unlike CK2 which has very few historical events  beyond the starting condition).
   - Trade is not as dynamic as Victoria, but still highlights he purpose of colonialism.
   - Map painting (?)

   > EU4 (16) - this is really close. The game is newer than CK2 or VIC2, it  runs a lot smoother, has far nicer graphics and it simply comes from  another generation. EU4 is great, its mechanics and the stories it  generates are definitely top tier, and it spans one of the commonly more beloved historical periods. It has a disgusting amount of DLCs,  similarly to CK2, but they cost more and aren’t necessarily better,  though the oncoming one will be enormous. Overall the game is great, but not amazing. It has few problems, but also few perks. But it’s almost  taken for granted that, possibly as close as next year, EU5 will be  announced, which will force this game to possibly slide into the same  path CK2 has taken, and thus be cheaper, maybe even free, and its DLCs  too. When this happens, this game goes to spot number 2 (18).

3. Imperator Rome. 

   - The empire building is nice (especially the building roads).
   - Character management part is too much of a chore as well as trade system.
   - Should be playable since v2.0.
   - Devs dropped support.

   > Imperator (9) - god I’m sorry for this game. Paradox has recognised its  mistake and has completely reworked the game (and its policies by the  looks of CK3). Imperator is now far better than it was at the start and  it doesn’t deserve the hate anymore, but I just don’t find it as  enjoyable as the others. I can’t point to a single, big problem, it’s  more how the game is built and I doubt that it’s going to be fixable.  Overall it’s just a bit boring, even though on paper it should be a  great mixture of EU4 and CK2

4. Crusader Kings 3 / 2

   - This is the only grand strategy game which focuses on characters than country.
   - Very fun game all around.
   - 3 isn't ready for now.

   > CK2 (20) - a bit of a tricky one, but at the end, still the best Paradox game. CK2 is the perfect mix of grand strategy and roleplay, combining  the best of both worlds. It is unparalleled in the stories it creates,  and has certainly had a lot of development over the years, more than any other title. The differences between playthroughs are the incredible,  especially with mods. You could play as a feudal count in france and the next day conquer the world as a satanist gengis khan, only to then  again play as an enlightened lord in India. The mechanics are great, the characters are great, the DLCs are many but cheap and it looks like its next chapter, CK3, is growing to be even better

5. Stellaris:

   - It is more of a civ-style 4X game.
   - Every exploration event is fun for the first time, and <u>only first time</u>. While the rest of the game is utterly boring.
   - You're making a lot of clicks that are of little use.
   - The game is interesting only the first few dozen hours.
   - People have their favourite historical Paradox game and then Stellaris is something different and fresh.
   - New game every year.

   > Stellaris (12) - same as EU4 and HOI4. It’s a really good game, it’s  fun, it works as intended. I just don’t particularly enjoy the setting.

6. Darkest Hour:

   > Sources: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/lhv8an/what_is_darkest_hour_and_why_you_should_buy_it/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/107cfu/for_those_of_you_who_havent_you_should_play/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1gn4x4/darkest_hour_would_you_recommend_this_to_someone/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1oqeio/darkest_hour_for_new_players/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/hkmal1/is_darkest_hour_any_good_in_2020/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/7c8r7q/is_darkest_hour_worth_it/).

   - The game is good without mods, but mods make it better. Good mods: Edge of Darkness, Kaiserreich (give it a lot of replayablity).
   - Furious difficulty = Active AI.
   - You can choose how long a scenario lasts for. So the 1914 scenario (WWI) with the maximum length (28 years) goes until 1942.
   - It is generally simpler than HOI3.
   - Best Hoi game by far followed by Hoi3 and Arsenal of Democracy.
     - It's the best version especially with the big mod s then the next best  is hoi3 Black ice then after it's pretty much everything else
   - The interface has not aged well. The map lacks resolution (which does make the AI better).
   - Manually moving troops is fun.
   - The only thing that could make it better is the ability to deploy half trained/supplied units like Hoi4. It would be a lot more useful in some cases instead of needing to complete one full divisions production.
   - Unlike later Hearts of Iron games, Darkest Hour and related mods tend to have a lot more focus on internal politics as opposed to just warfare. It's not as deep as Victoria II, for example, but it works really well in-engine in a way that Kaiserreich for HOI4 can't really do without applying to HOI4 a design philosophy that wasn't made for the game.

   > The max stack of units is 24, if one of them is a HQ or next to a HQ. Also good war advise.
   >
   > Personally I usually play germany and make two army corps of double size with full tech and nice attached brigades and of course commanded by the best  generals, then I just sort of shit out generic 3-div corps and as soon  as its time to scale up, simply add units to existing corps.
   >
   > You can always pause and sit back and think if you feel overwhelmed. In  fact that is quite nice I think. You can go over the stat pages or look  at the map.
   >
   > Granted, while you can set your production to basically automatic(supply my people and army  while producing what I say and anything extra use to upgrade units) and  just line things up for your country to build, research has to be picked and combined with research teams, you will have many of those corps  after a while and there will be a lot happening. One thing to try is to  disable more events than prudents, so you dont get popups even for  fairly important stuff like enemy is attacking you in x province, you'll see how its going approximately from a birds eye view anyway.
   >
   > Then again taking 24 garrison units, splitting them in to 24 pieces, and  sending them out to 24 different provinces gets old. That's almost 100  clicks just to make the french shut up and work. That does get old  especially since if they are any other unit than garrison you will also  need to select each and every one once they have been invisible and  arrived someplace, then select the menu of actions, then after that,  select anti-partisan duties. Doing this with normal units and you end up breaking up all those corps from before. Game has low quality of life.
   >
   > But its worth it and personally I solve it by building multi-roles for both air fighting and land support, infantry with artillery here and there,  and clone fleets. Then the tanks and bombers are just sort of extra.  Uniformity as far as necessity allows, in other words, is what I found  helps. That and relative safety. as USA this is automatic, as UK you can put units i all the landable provinces and put most of the fleet out of reach of german bombers but not so far that they could't helpif they  try to land. As germany, take over denmark to block the allies from  going past their islands, and putting your fleet in rostock (they will  get bombed by canadians but and for some reason always canadians, but  canadians can't take much of a punch, their industry is too weak to  replace the bombers you shoot down.)
   >
   > If you start with a big navy like UK or Japan, just group them all at  literally the same place then start making purpose fleets (usually  battle winning fleets and submarine chasing fleets/dont care if i lose  this old ship is run with sail for crying out loud which just sorta go  around in small groups and scout.

   > If you have no experience with HOI2, then guides for that can be useful.  The major difference is the mobilization system (manpower is given to  you in bulk based on your level of mobilization/total manpower of your  country, which you can increase or decrease via decisions; in HOI2,  manpower ticked up infinitely based on the manpower value of your  provinces). There are some others (I haven't played in a fair bit). I  will say that starting as a medium strength country is far less  overwhelming to a new player. Stuff like Italy (who has the ability to  choose alliances or stay on their own) is nice. Also, Canada gives you a basically impervious base of operations to fool around with, and the  smaller axis countries can focus solely on ground operations (you may  lose the game if Germany is stupid, but its still a good game to learn  in)
   >
   > - Tech: Each country has tech teams, that activate in certain years, and  de-activate in certain years. They have a skill level (affects tech  speed) and fields of expertise (that halve the amount of time it takes  to run through the corresponding area of the tech, which are listed when you click on the tech). Generally speaking, use the tech team that has  the most applicable fields of expertise, unless the skill gap is huge.  Some countries won't have tech teams to research niche things like nukes (these are generally smaller countries that wouldn't bother with it  anyhow).
   > - Production: I assume you know how to build things. Keep the army models you use up  to date, and build however many you want in the production tab. DH has  long production times, so you need to plan far in advance (infantry  take... well over half a year, I believe. Gearing bonuses help with  this, but you lose them when you upgrade the queue to the newer model).  If you're a larger country, this can get a bit convoluted, so try a  smaller one to get the hang of it: smaller axis nations will only really be producing infantry (within the limits of their manpower), before  moving on to Aircraft when that becomes an issue (and when they finally  get decent air tech), so they have this easy. I find this part a lot  easier than it looks: simply build infantry units (with brigades; I  usually use armoured cars/various types of artillery, but you can fool  around with this. Just make sure to keep the models up to date) and  organize them into armies. The only really difficult part of early army  buildup is balancing mobilization with how much you build up. You are  going to take lots of casualties, so don't overbuild too much; use  partial mobilization for the interwar building up period when you want  to start building divisions. Most countries can get away with building  some industry (you can do this by clicking on individual provinces, the  factory icon) in the beginning year or two, this helps especially if it  will increase the amount of concurrent techs you can research (goes up  by one for every 20 industry you have; so at 20, you have 2, 40 you have 3, etc.). So essentially, in the beginning, stick to a largely infantry army with an airforce.
   > - Air units: The airforce can be kind of tricky: they upgrade like army  divisions (ships don't upgrade, keep it in mind), and take a lot of  industry to make. Generally speaking: TAC bombers are jack of all  trades, they can do anything, just not as well. CAS are for killing  troops. They lack protection (can't use the escort fighter brigade) but  do a ton of damage. STRAT bombers are for infrastructure; don't bother  with these unless you're the US trying something fun, they're super  expensive and TAC bombers do the job well enough. NAV are very useful  for sea control, you'll really only use them as smaller nations with  terrible navies, or as Germany in some Sea Lion strategies involving  killing the Royal Navy. Fighters are easier; Interceptors are better at  dogfighting, but are shorter range. Fighters can attack ground troops  better (still bad at it) and are longer range. Use interceptors most of  the time. Fighters are nice for quickly moving fronts that are large  (like invading Russia) or in the Pacific Ocean/China, just because of  the large area you'll be fighting in. Base aircraft in airbases in  groups of 4 divisions, and devote some time to attaining air superiority before bombing, or you will take casualties (air superiority mission on interceptors). Ground Attack mission on bombers will cause strength  damage (casualties) while the ground interdiction missions lower  organization divs can't fight if they have no org). A basic strategy  with air units: clear an area of enemy fighters with superiority, send  in bombers to interdict, to lower morale. Rout the force with a ground  army, then while they retreat, use ground attack to cause massive  casualties (they lose all defensive bonuses while retreating). An  airforce is essential to any fast offensive, and at least defensive air  units are essential to protect your own ground troops.
   > - Navy: Managing navies can get convoluted, I'm not very good at it. [This article](http://www.paradoxian.org/hoi2wiki/index.php/Naval_Primer) on the HOI2 wiki should still apply most of the time. Use your navy to  protect landings (in conjunction with airforce. Bombers can wreck a  fleet with no air protection) and prevent enemy landings. Only really  useful as USA/Japan/sometimes Germany. AI Germany won't really be able  to challenge the UK's starting navy, so don't worry too much about it.  Do make use of naval brigades though. Your navy will suck without them.
   >
   > If you have more specific questions I would be happy to answer them. The  mobilization system can be fairly tricky, and make sure to figure out  what all the different actions you can assign to groups of divisions do  (ex: attack moves the group into the province it is attacking, while  support attack keeps the division in their province when the attack  ends, but participates in the assault on the province). Also, play  Kaiserreich, its fantastic.

7. Hearts of Iron 4:

   - With mods only (Equestria at War, Kaiserreich, TNO, Expert AI).
   - Best experience in multiplayer.
   - The AI is incompetent.
   - Too focused on war.
   - Best World War II video game.
   - Hoi4 massively simplified most of the game, except production and supply. 
   - They turned the combat into an arrow-painter, which is a shame.
   - Other improvements in HoI4: template designer, equipment production, one click unit upgrades etc.
   - Other disadvantages in HoI4: the national focuses, lack of tech teams/ the beefy tech tree and the arcadey air combat and logistics.

   > What about other HoI games? HoI 3 Black Ice is nice.
   
   > HOI4 (14) - from now on the games, while really good, just aren’t on the same level as the first threw. This is really similar to EU4, as in  great, but not special. It works exactly like it was intended and is  really funny overall. Most people would put it higher, and it probably  deserves it, but I just don’t particularly enjoy the period nor the  “total war” feeling it gives, since I much prefer creating stories and  guiding the country/dynasty over the centuries.

### Flight simulator

"2019: What simulator should I get?", the flowchart:

![](https://i.imgur.com/6xIthpI.jpg)

#### Amateur flight simulation

Microsoft Flight Simulator X.

> More for Systems Simulation: MS FS2004 and X with VATSIM and PMDG planes and others

X-Plane 11.

> For the Feeling of flying: X-Plane.

> X-Plane 11 is the up-and-comer in the flight sim world. Although X-Plane itself has been around for a while, its 11th iteration is the first one to really gather momentum and make significant inroads into FSX/P3D's market share. It includes a number of fantastic new technologies, including PBR, WIP support for Vulkan, and is 64 bit. It is arguably one of the best civilian simulators around, since it looks pretty good out of the box, and is relatively cheap to get looking and running very well. The sim of choice for those on a budget.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - $60 price
> - Supports 'Ortho4XP'- converting satellite images into sim terrain for extremely accurate and gorgeous terrain
> - Excellent Boeing 737 available to download for free
> - Mature VR support
> - Selection of pay ware content is not as good as FSX and P3D. High quality airliners include the 727, 737, 757, 767 and A320. Some good GA aircraft such as the TBM 900
> - Overall has a worse pay ware ecosystem than FSX and P3D, although it is possible this will change in the future
>
> [X-Plane Website](https://www.x-plane.com/)

Prepar3Dv4.

> Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D simulation software is an extension of the much-loved FSX simulator from 2006. It is in active development and boasts new features such as 64-bit support, PBR, and a VR mode. Because it is based off the ESP platform, it has an overwhelming amount of payware available for it- if you name it, you can probably buy it. The downside is that the simulator looks pretty poor without third party mods, so it only really starts to shine once you invest $150+ into it. If you do not have this kind of cash to burn then there are other, more attractive sims for the same price.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - $60 initial price
> - Incredibly wide range of high quality airliners and scenery- study level 717, 737, 747, 777, A320, very high quality 757, 787, MD80 etc.
> - Mature payware ecosystem thanks to ESP roots
> - VR support
> - Does not look very good without extra add ons. Once money has been invested into the sim, it looks significantly better and on par with other civilian simulators
> - Very expensive in the long run. Aircraft often sell for $100+
>
> [Prepar3D website](https://www.prepar3d.com/)

FSX.

> The oldest civilian simulator still seeing significant use. Has its roots back to 2002, this venerable software was the program of choice for many years. Nowadays it is less relevant due to the proliferation of X-Plane and Prepar3D. Dated technology means that it is not recommended for any new simmers who are serious about the hobby. However, it still goes on sales down to $5 so it can be ideal for someone who is just looking to dip their toes in. Although there is still a fairly healthy steam community, it is gradually declining in popularity and likely won't be around for much longer.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - $25 initial price, with sales down to $5
> - Very high range of payware and freeware
> - Old technology- no native VR support, 32 bit, poorly optimised
> - Looks poor with no addons.. and not wise to buy for the platform at this point in its life
> - Potentially good for beginners, but most people have moved on nowadays
>

Aerofly FS2.

> For non-combat Aerofly FS2 and X-Plane 11 in VR.

> A very new, very modern flight simulator with emphasis on civilian operations. It is very well optimised and works well with VR- something that X-Plane and P3D sometimes struggle with. However, it is very limited since it does not model the entire globe, the aircraft are not particularly detailed and there is not a significant market for third party addons. While it has potential, for $15 more you could get X-Plane or P3D so I personally don't currently recommend it.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - $45 initial price
> - Excellent performance- most optimised modern sim available
> - Only a few regions to fly around in, so global flights are impossible
> - Very few third party addons
> - One to watch?
>
> [Aerofly Website](http://www.aeroflyfs.com/)

FlightGear.

> A free, open sourced simulator aimed at catering to third party developers and those with lower spec computers. A wide range of different aircraft and regions to fly in, although quality is consistently lower than that found on other platforms. Very good for learning some of the basics if you're unsure of making an investment into another desktop sim.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - Free and open sourced
> - Good range of extra content
> - Not on same level of quality as X-Plane 11 or P3D, but, it's free

> [Flight Gear Website](http://home.flightgear.org/)

#### Combat flight simulator

DCS (Digital Combat Simulator)

> For combat DCS, but I am still at the bottom of a steep learning curve.

> The base game is free, and comes with the Caucuses map, and you can fly the T-51 (A weaponless P-51 trainer) and the SU-25T (Low fidelity, meaning the cockpit isn’t fully modeled where you can click all the buttons to operate it instead of using keyboard shortcuts).
>
> Stick with that until you get a feel for how you like the game. Similar to Star Citizen, any other plane you want to fly comes in the form of a dlc module that are upwards of $80 for the newest full-fidelity plane.
>
> Come on over to [r/hoggit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/) and join the Discord, and you’ll find plenty of help.
>
> *edit: also, almost everyone will suggest getting the game directly from the website, vs using Steam. This won’t really matter though until you start spending money.

> Probably *the* definitive military flight simulator around. Free to download, but there are a wide variety of different modules- both free and paid. Superb realism and map detail, easily one of the best looking simulators out there. Covers a wide variety of time periods.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - Free to download
> - Extremely realistic- some modules officially licensed by manufacturers etc.
> - Looks excellent

IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946

> Although it is an older simulator, it still has some excellent content available for it and is popular with many players. Primarily focuses on WW2 content
>
> *Key points*
>
> - Free to download with paid modules
> - Large amount of content to download
> - Can be somewhat pricey
>
> [Buy on GOG](http://www.gog.com/game/il_2_sturmovik_1946)

> No mention of IL-2 Great Battles series (Battle of Stalingrad/Moscow/Kuban)?
>
> Good update of Il-2: Sturmovik with very good support and implementation of VR, probably the best besides DCS.
>
> The Great Battles Series is the latest installment of the IL-2 series, it runs on a totally new updated engine, looks much better than the various older IL-2 games.
>
> The Great Battles Series has 3 components, Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow, and Battle of Kuban. Each takes place during a different time period in the Eastern Front of WW2 as noted by the names. You can each individually, so you can buy Battle of Stalingrad only and get access to that campaign and planes, then you can by Battle of Moscow later followed by Kuban and get those campaigns and planes added. Or you can buy them in whatever order you want, you can only buy Battle of Moscow, or Kuban only if you want.
>
> There's also good multiplayer support so you can take part in multiplayer battles with dynamic fronts by flying bomber missions and taking out airfields and factories, or fly fighters and do dog-fighting against other players, or you can do a dynamic or scripted campaign for single player (scripted campaign is a separate add-on that costs extra).
>
> There are also other downloadable planes you can buy.
>
> There's an upcoming module called Battle of Bodenplatte that is in early access right now which brings the game to the western front during Bodenplatte and will feature aircraft under the western allied air forces (the other ones are all German or Soviet planes, with some western allied planes under Soviet insignia) such as the Thunderbolt.
>
> Also, as I mentioned, it has really good VR integration. I've tried DCS, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad, War Thunder and XP11 in VR and I would rate IL-2: BoS as number 2 after DCS in terms of VR integration.
>
> In terms of realism and how hardcore of a sim it is, it's right in between DCS and War Thunder Realistic Battles although you can vary the settings a bit too and turn over a lot of the manual stuff over to the computer to automate so you can just click a few switches to start the plane and fly.
>
> It SHOULD be noted that IL-2 Great Battle Series can get pretty expensive, each uh module or component is regularly priced as a full game by itself, and add-on planes are also not cheap and probably cost about half of a game each. So a lot of IL-2 fans are not happy with this pricing model.

### Space flight simulator

Here is the complete [list](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_space_flight_simulator_games) of space flight simulator games.

Top of the space flight simulator games (if we merge all the paragraphs into one) according to people:

1. FreeSpace 2 (and Diaspora). Good mission-based and classic military style space sim. Freespace 2 is the pinnacle of space combat.
2. Kerbal Space Program. One of the most realistic space sims. Great at teaching you some basics about orbital dynamics.
3. Freelancer. Good entry point into the genre. Fun game. Fun combat (probably too simple). It's more "action game" than "hardcore sim". Awesome 3D dogfighting and a good story to go with it. KBMouse controls are excellent and intuitive.
4. X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude. X3 is a good trade/empire-building space sim (than a true "fly spaceship sim"; it is a non-Newtonian space sim). X3 is excellent if you can get through the slow start, tad dated combat, spaghetti interface, steep learning curve and insane micro management. X4 is a solid entry to the series after X3 (X: Rebirth is terrible, avoid).
5. Elite: Dangerous. Good modern space sim. For just flying around Elite Dangerous is pretty decent. Nice visuals and sound. For content, not so much. Poor combat. Good for VR.

#### Space flight simulator games

Kerbal Space Program.

> If we want to get technical, Kerbal space is the most realistic space sim out there and its loads of fun. Docking a ship with a space station in that game is probably one of the most difficult tasks I've ever done in a video game, and it feels glorious.

> *Kerbal Space Program* is great at teaching you some basics about orbital dynamics and is a fun simulation for a (somewhat) more realistic take.

> For Space "flying": Kerbal Space Program

SpaceEngine.

> SpaceEngine is free, gorgeous, and it is possible to fly a space ship through the entire universe.
>
> > Definitely recommend giving Space Engine a try. It's not much of a game, but there is some orbital physics and exploration with ships. You can explore the entire known universe, and even more procedurally generated galaxies, all with their own stars, nebulas, planets and black holes.

Orbiter 2016.

> A free software package in continuous development that simulates various aspects of historical and futuristic spaceflight. Definitely worth checking out if outer space interests you.
>
> *Key points*
>
> - Free to download
> - Continually in development
> - Wide variety of ships and scenarios
>
> [Orbiter Website](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/).

#### Space combat games

FreeSpace 2 and Diaspora.

> **FreeSpace 2** is largely considered the best space combat sim ever made, and remains my favorite game of all time. While it has a very large amount of keybindings (about 4 pages worth), you only *really* need about a dozen of them and the actual gameplay is straightforward and it has a very arcade flight model. Excellent gameplay with a very interesting story. It sits in the genre of what is called a 'Military space combat sim', which is mission-based fighter pilot fare, not open world or anything. FS2 released in 1999, but the source code has been updated via FreeSpace SCP and the graphics have been overhauled significantly. Still an amazing game. Also has what is in my opinion the best and most talented modding community in PC gaming. If you're new to the genre, I'd actually start right here.

> If you have a joystick, grab a copy of Freespace and Freespace 2.
>
> 2 of the best space sim fighter games in existence
>
> You can grab both from GOG, also grab the FSOpen mod to make them look pretty.

> For mission-based, classic military style space sim? [FreeSpace 2 SCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhAR8rWPluQ). Due to probably the best modding community in existence, more than a decade after release it's still unsurpassed.

> For trade/empire-building space sim? X3.
>

> IMO no space game since has even given you a feeling of just how insignificant you are flying a dinky little fighter beside 2-kilometre long cap ships that will vaporize you with a glancing hit from their beam cannons. The mission design departs from the typical SP game where the player is some all-important savior of mankind character, and puts you in the role of a single fighter pilot fighting in a war as part of a greater machine. You really get the sense that it doesn't matter if you live or die.. you'll just become another notch on the causality list and the war will go on without you. Someone described FreeSpace once as being the only space sim where you feel the *weight* of combat around you, and it's very true. Kind of hard to describe. The game didn't do anything revolutionary but it took the best aspects of classic 90's space sims and perfected them.

> Freespace 2 comes to mind for the story driven option. It is a combat game though.

> I just played through Freespace 2 and loved it. Of all the older space sims, this one's gameplay feels the most polished. I'm now fiddling with the open source campaign editor to write my own campaign, wishing I had Star Citizen ship models to make a SC story. This game can be very heavily modded, including updating it to modern graphics. But even on Medium difficulty, if you're not managing your power and strategically giving orders to other fighters, you will lose. Being a good pilot only gets you so far. Some of my most successful missions were ones in which I didnt get a single kill, but I'm more into the strategy than the flying itself.

> *EDIT: One of the mods is a Battlestar Galactica campaign called Diaspora. It is superb. You play a Viper jock on another Battlestar fleeing the cylons. There's nothing quite like starting every mission being launched from a Battlestar. It feels just like the show. It is free and standalone:* http://diaspora.hard-light.net/.

> Freespace 2

> Freespace, and Freespace 2 are the pinnacle of space combat.

> Freespace: The Great War - Fantastic campaign, great building of tension and mission variety, excellent tactical dogfighting and resource management. The sequel is even better in my opinion. Still one of my favorite games.

> I'd recommend [FreeSpace 2](http://www.gog.com/game/freespace_2), although that one is admittedly more fun with a joystick

> The most fun? FreeSpace 2.
>
> Why? It's the only space game I've ever played that you feel the *weight* of combat around you. No other game makes such a tiny fighter feel so incredibly insignificant fighting beside 2 kiliometre long capital ships. When you're in a heavy flak barrage and getting nailed by AF beam cannons your puny little insect of a ship is getting swatted around so much your only priority is hitting the burners and *getting the hell out of there.* So, so good.

> >
> > > IMO space combat in Elite has *nothing* on FreeSpace 2, especially when you're buzzing around capital ships that are duking it out with their beam cannons while pelting you with FLAK. Nothing says "insignificant" more than getting glanced by anti-cap ship weapons and having your fighter vaporize.

It felt basically like an FPS in space with no sense of inertia to your ship. I've heard that the physics engines of that era were largely to blame, but I'd still take something with a little drift and momentum instead of a 6DOF FPS.

Everspace.

> I enjoyed Everspace, which is FTL's progression mixed with Freelancer's combat. It also has VR, though I lasted all of 3 minutes (motion sickness).
>
> If you're looking for a less in-the-cockpit experience, I would dig into space roguelikes. Someone already mentioned FTL, but there are a bound to be a few that are close to what you're thinking of.
>
> > Is Everspace actually fun? It's on sale now on Steam, and it's been on my wish list for the longest time, but I'm just not sure...
> >
> > > I think so, but I only put 10 hours into it and haven't beaten it. I'm surprised it was only 10 when I looked, felt like more. I still hit a motion sickness wall around 2-3 hours in though, which is probably the reason - I don't get sick in many first person or VR games, but the full 3d space stuff slowly gets to me for whatever reason.
> > >
> > > The storytelling is basically like FTL lite, where you go sector to sector and occasionally there's "plot", but after your first time clearing a "main plot event" you won't see it again.
> > >
> > > The gameplay is VERY freelancer-like, with full 3d space combat and "leading your target" due to bullet travel time. Also, fairly limited resources and ship slots, like FTL. However, it has a metagame progression system where currency earned can help you start stronger next time (if you manage to get any before dying). I don't think this hard-blocks progression, but it sure makes it easier. This is pretty important because you start out very weak and while you're learning the game, you'll inevitably have a few instances where you died so quickly you don't know what happened. Finally like in FTL you'll have to balance spending time in a sector with doing the best you can using whatever resources you stumble across.
> > >
> > > I haven't played with the DLC but anything that adds more content variety is probably worth grabbing, especially once you're reliably clearing the first couple sectors every play - the game is super pretty, but once you know combat in the early areas isn't going to be tough (unless you start a fight you "shouldn't"), more variety of enemies and choice around weapons sounds awesome.

> Yes I still play Privateer every month or so. Never really enjoyed the other more mission based ones though.
>
> Not sure why you think Dosbox somehow negates the value of a GOG release?
>
> > The original Wing Commander doesn't have a frame limiter built into it (one was added for the second expansion pack, Secret Missions 2). Because of that, there is no CPU cycle that works flawlessly in DOSBox. If you raise the cycles with lots of ships on screen, it will then run wayyyy too fast when you destroy said ships. If you leave default, it will slow to a complete crawl.
> >
> > You have to constantly be adjusting the CPU cycle with F11/F12 as you play, every mission, multiple times a mission. It's an absolute disaster but it's not DOSBox's fault, it's the game's code and it happens if you run the original floppies on anything faster than a 386.
> >
> > The only way to play it right is to use the Kilrathi Saga versions that were released later for Windows 95, with frame limiters finally built in. You will need to use a patch that a fan made to get it to run on modern machines, but it works great and adds tons of functionality (can alt+enter into a window, for one). It also has the better, orchestrated soundtrack. Check it out if you want to enjoy them!

> Don't see the problem with GoG dosbox games, they all run perfectly on my windows 10 pc. Was playing privateer waiting on for RGO release. Now Privateer 2 that one is a bit touchy, but really don't get the dosbox hate, no editing needed, runs straight out of the box just fine.

The combat didn't have the same feel and wasn't very fun to play, WC3's story seemed like a rehash of both Star Wars and WC2 but with a worse twist, and WC3 ended the Kilrathi. I didn't *hate* them and they do have their moments, but they're definitely not games I replay.

> > >
> > > > Ah, well I still disagree lol. It's heavily nostalgic for me I guess. It was mindblowing as a kid in 1990. A lot of it stuck with me and formed my opinions about feel and immersion. It may sound ridiculous, but I just love everything about those games, down to the slowdowns and guns not firing sometimes because the on-screen sprite count gets too high. There's just so much innovation and personality in the early Wing Commander games. The later games in the series don't *feel* right to me, and I'm sure some of that comes down to the early WC games' fake-3D sprites and how they move. Though I can understand how it might be distracting if you're used to... not that, lol

> I still replay all the OriginFX engine Wing Commanders (1, 2, and Privateer) at least once a year and they run flawlessly in DOSbox on Linux. Never had a problem on Windows either.
>
> I am admittedly a wingnut and had no need of the GOG versions because I still have my original copies from the 90s, but if I didn't then it would absolutely be worth it to me to pay a few bucks for them.

> Honestly the entire series is great, starting with the first game. The mission design in the first game is top-notch, and there's some really great emergent cinematic gameplay in the sequel. The 2D graphics in the first two games haven't aged terribly well, however. If playing games with older sprite-based graphics is hard for you, then Wing Commander 3 is a good starting point. If you can handle them, then go ahead and start at the beginning!

> For me, the second game, but I like old school games and am yet to play the third so I am not super qualified.

> I'd say start with any of them except IV. WC4 is a fantastic game, but it will be really hard and you won't dig the story as much if you haven't played 3. Both 3 and 4 have an all star sci-fi cast and are two of the few FMV games done right. One warning about 3, some gamepads and flight sticks are a pain to calibrate without using some odd config tricks if you want analog control. 
>
> Privateer has a open world design with a plot that is a heavy inspiration for Star Citizen. If you don't mind old school fun and some slowdown issues, start with 1 or 2.

> Based purely on my preferences, start with 3 or Privateer.

> *Most* of the WC games from GOG.com can be played on a modern machine, though with a few hiccups and inconsistent joystick support. WC2 I remember having some significant problems because the GOG CPU timing in DosBox was off, meaning it didn't properly register the hits of your projectiles on enemy ships. WC3 and 4 both worked fine.
>
> There's also the Wing Commander Saga, a total conversion for FreeSpace 2 SCP. I haven't played it in a long time but I remember it being pretty damned good.

> If you don't mind the 2d sprites used to fake 3d wc1/2 pack is a good start. Also privateer.

**Is it worth playing Wing Commander to get an idea of where Star Citizen will be in the future?**

> If you want a feel for what Star Citizen is going to be, play Privateer 1, and Freelancer. If you want to know how Squadron 42 is going to play, try out Wing Commander and Starlancer.

> > > I liked Privateer 2, but it definitely has its own feel to it. A year or so ago (in 2015 I guess), Chris explained why. Apparently Privateer 2 was done almost entirely by his brother, and it wasn't even supposed to be a Wing Commander game. They just decided to switch it over partway through development to take advantage of the Wing Commander IP's strength (IIRC).

> The flight model in WC1 is btw surprisingly good, the lack of proper 3D engine might be in the way as you have a hard time to guess angles to enemy ships, how far your slides need to go, etc
>
> But your actual ship as weight, drifts, and you can actually plan your movement better ahead than you could in all SC versions up to 2.0
> Furthermore the manual itself comes with good tips, maneuvers and explanations how they work, all that stuff does still apply to today. But the visuals are really in the way of seeing all those details, quite literally as ships have only 18 different views on them at best, properly even less, for the most part you just see a 2D sprite representation enemy and allied ships and one of those 18 (or less) 2D pixel artworks gets loaded depending on your position to those ships.
>
> Basically it is a 3D flight model within a 2D graphic engine. Less sophisticated than even doom 1 … but the movement and actual flying is full 3D.

> Yeah, you can count the pixels, but Privateer is still really a lot more engaging and more fun to play than Freelancer. Which applies even to its direct predecessor privateer 2, which simply was not as good as privateer 1, especially as the righteous fire expansion was great.
>
> And I am not talking out of nostalgia, I have played freelancer before privateer. I had my first privateer playthrough just a few years ago when I grabbed all the old wing commander cames on GOG.com
>
> But yeah, graphics are awful and they were not even good by 1993 standards as that is the year the original x-wing has been released as well. -^

> I'd skip ahead and play wing commander 3. It's the first one with live action cutscenes and has a couple of the famous actors like Mark Hammil that will be in s42. Its also a very fun game.

> With a joystick even wc1 is still a fun game, so it is totally worth buying and playing and should give you a good impression how far the SC project has deviated from the wing commander games by now.
> WC1 and WC2 and their secret mission packs are rather dated. They are still surprisingly fun games once you get used to the very small field of view and super simple graphics, WC3-5 use 3D engines and ages ok, especially 5 with an openGL patch looks still really good imho. Privateer 1 is even by today's standards a great game despite using the same style of engine as WC1 and WC2. There is iirc better graphic remake of that which plays exactly the same, but looks a lot better than the original. Still super dated graphics though, but looks about twice as good :)

> I'm seeing a lot of love for Freelancer which is peculiar as the game is played from the 3rd person.
>
> I recommend instead [Wing Commander: The Darkest Dawn](http://www.wcsaga.com/index.php/rs-downloads/download.html?path=releases%2Fdarkest-dawn-setup.zip). Although this is a fan made game I was very pleased at the depth of the controls. You probably have better control options here than the standard Wing Commander game, but I'll also mention I've been pleasantly surprised that the depth of control options in Star Citizen even exceeds that.

> It's worth playing Wing Commander to get an idea of where Star Citizen was in the **past**.

Plus, you should know that [Eterium](http://store.steampowered.com/app/280200/) is a modern Wing Commander which can scratch the same itch.

Independence War 2.

> An interesting Steam review [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/schmatzler/recommended/359630/).
>
> > This game is not your average space shooter where you just fly and blow up things in space. It uses Newtonian physics, so you will have to learn how to steer your ship in space and when to accelerate and decelerate. Just like in real space. :-)

House of the Dying Sun. Fun.

Arvoch Alliance. Read more about the series (which is made by one man) [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Star_Wraith_(video_game_series)).

> On the other end of the spectrum you have games like **Evochron Legacy** and **Arvoch Alliance**, which, IMHO, are the only two space combat sims that actually <u>do Newtonian physics even close to fun</u>. These games are complex and a little obtuse, but have a charm that is unmatched by any other game.

Star Wars: TIE Fighter, Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.

> If you want combat and fun, and ditch the realism, you should go over to GOG and get some of the old Star Wars games. My personal fave is TIE Fighter, but I also love X-Wing Alliance.

Other games: Starshatter: The gathering storm, Aquanox and Aquanox 2, Starlancer, Strike Suit Zero, Void Destroyer.

> Starshatter:The gathering storm. start as a pilot, work your way into the command deck. Newtonian physics, full 6-degrees of freedom.
>
> It is light on story, but it's plenty of fun. You don't ever have to sit in the command seat if you don't want either
>
> > This was something new. Also [there seems to be an open source download](http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=80935.0) for it.

> Check out Aquanox and Aquanox 2. While not in space, the controls are similar, and it's a bunch of very enjoyable games. You might not like that they aren't open though. Think the last part of Freelancer story, you do a mission, then talk to people (there's an outrageous amount of text in Aquanoxes), upgrade your stuff and do more missions. What really captivated me about is is the setting. It's the 27th century and mankind fucked up the surface so bad they had to start living underwater.
>
> Aquanox 2 is the newest (2003) so it's also the smoothest and with the nicest graphical interface. AQN1 has menus based solely on text (these two use the same engine though, so AQN1 is reasonably aged). There's also a game called Archimedean Dynasty, to which AQN1 is a direct sequel. But it's old, from 1996. AQN2 happens concurrently with AQN1, so there's a different protagonist, and you can encounter some people and events from the first game - but you aren't required to play it to be able to enjoy 2. Just might miss some references. Note: I love the world of the series. It's not something that was done much in games.

> Also there's Starlancer, the game Freelancer is a spiritual successor to (very very loosely, it's a sequel - it's set in the same universe). Oh and the man behind Freelancer, Chris Roberts is currently heading the development of something called Star Citizen. Which is basically Wing Commander + Freelancer + MMO. It's in beta right now, the only thing I don't like about it is that just mouse + keyboard is a bit cumbersome (but I have the slowest ship so what do I know).
>
> > I heard somewhere that if you've played Freelancer, you've already played Starlancer as the former is a refined and expanded version of the latter.
>
> Eh, you heard right. Starlancer is constrained into mission structure. When Freelancer came, it brought the open world with it. So FL aged much better than SL. Besides, where else can you find art deco starships?

> Strike Suit Zero - it just never stops being fun, never cares about being realistic, it just puts you inside huge battles and turns the anime up to 11.

> Void Destroyer is another game you can look at. You can pilot a ship and it's weapons like Freelancer, then switch to an RTS view while building ships, maneuvering 3D environments, upgrading your hero unit. Real time with pause (actually, time slows down when you switch ships or press the space bar).

#### Free-form space trading and combat games

Freelancer.

> On the arcade end of the spectrum you have games like **Freelancer**, which is widely considered one of the best examples of its kind. It's solidly a 3rd person arcade shooter that just happens to take place in space. Fun story, fun gameplay, fun characters, excellent modding. Great game all around.

> Unfortunately that kind of space sim is a very difficult kind of game to build, and has a very small market. No one's really pulled off the quality of Freelancer ever since, and a lot have tried.
>
> I share your interest in the genre but honestly, <u>nothing scratches the itch</u>. The most enjoyable large scale, deep space sim I know of is EVE, but it involves a monthly fee and has a massive learning curve so it isn't what you're looking for.
>
> I know of a lot of space games (not space sims) that I would describe as excellent, but like I said, this genre has very poor representation. I don't see that changing in the near future either, tbh.
>
> > Talking about space games, I'm seeing there are games that are either quite simple, somewhat moderately challenging, or overwhelmingly complex. So, not a lot of mid-difficulty games to get easily into.
> > (I consider Freelancer to have the right amount of complexity, difficulty, and introduction to systems and mechanics that anyone whose played a game before can pick it up.)

> Freelancer Alpha one-dash-one, you're cleared for launch!
>
> That game... the first one I ever bought (or got bought by parents, rather) and one of the first I played. While the limitations show (according to the original plan it was supposed to be more open, but Microsoft said no), it's still a high-quality game. Many bonus points for having controls that you don't need a joystick for.

> Freelancer was such a fun game. Awesome 3D dogfighting and a good story to go with it.
>
> Also, similar genre but totally different gameplay, Flatspace was a blast. Great top-down space-sim dogfighting indie game.

> A lot of people recommend Freelancer.. and while it's a good game, combat in it is about as shit simple as it comes. Starlancer is the prequel to Freelancer and has *much* better combat. But it's also a very, very different game.

> *Freelancer* is still awesome after all these years and the KBMouse controls are excellent and intuitive. And, of course, combat is fun. It's more "action game" than "hardcore sim" but that sounds like what you wanted anyway.

X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude. X4.

> You have the **X** series (of which **X4** is the latest) that is really more of a space economic sim than a true "fly spaceship sim". X4 is a solid entry to the series after X3 (X: Rebirth is terrible, avoid). The X games have a learning cliff though. And 90% of that cliff is all about managing your economic engine, not actually anything related to flying your ship.

> **X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude**
>
> A non-Newtonian spaceflight sim where you jump between systems using gates. You can trade and do missions for different factions. It supports the use of a joystick.
>
> > > Are there any with simple and intuitive controls? What one would you recommend for someone starting out with space sim games?
> >
> > ------
> >
> > > X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude
> >
> > hmmmmmmm.
> >
> > Honestly, for someone totally new, I'd probably say start with Rebel Galaxy. It doesn't have the depth of X3 or the scale of Elite Dangerous, but it's relatively easy to pick up and scratches a similar itch.
> >
> > If you pick up Rebel Galaxy and enjoy the whole "I'm a spaceship! I grind money and get upgrades and get better ships!" gameplay, then you're ready to dive into a much harder game to control. Personally I'd recommend X3, I played E:D but don't really think I had fun.

> X3, if you can make it past the interface, is still the best space sim. Haven't heard good things about X: Rebirth.
>
> It has a bit of a learning curve. Things aren't always apparent as there's a lot of icons and tiny UI elements on screen.

> If we want to get technical, Kerbal space...
>
> But as others have said X3 is excellent if you can get through the slow start, steep learning curve and insane micro management. Elite is very pretty but feels very empty right now, there's not a lot to actually do.

> Yup. X3 is the way to go. As others have said, there's a steep learning curve, and the combat is a tad dated.
>
> While the combat doesn't quite match up to the newer ED, or SC, X3 offers so much more in content that the outdated combat mechanics are hardly something to complain about. You can take it a step further and mod the game (there's a large selection of mods) to suit your tastes, while adding hundreds of hours of content.
>
> As for the other 2 big games that are always being discussed right now, ED is shallow and completely lacking in content, while SC is merely an early alpha.

> For trade/empire-building space sim? X3.

> I'll add another vote for X3. Between X3: Terran Conflict, and X3: Albion Prelude (doesn't really matter which one you play first, but I guess Albion Prelude is the 'cleanest' iteration of X3), I've clocked 500-600 hours of playtime over at least 3 different play-through attempts.
>
> One of the best aspects of the X series is that in addition to the "start with small ship, trade / fight / explore your way to bigger ship, rinse and repeat indefinitely" aspect, the X3 games allow you to build an actual intergalactic corporation filled with dozens of space stations that you own and operate.
>
> You can set-up a weapons manufacturing facility in Terran space, an illegal drugs facility in alien space, an energy production facility in another alien's space, etc. So while you're off in your ship getting into trouble, you've got your space stations producing in the background. You can even buy and automate freighter ships to conduct trade and maintain your space stations while you're away.
>
> The main downsides, I think, of the X series are the pretty steep learning curve, and how ridiculous micromanaging can get, especially the later you go in the game. After 100 hours in any of my playthroughs, I was looking at spreadsheets and menus as often as I was looking at space. Still, the best space sim games I've ever played.

> > Looking for an immersive space sim with lots to do, explore, and trade. Lots of NPCs to talk to and a sotry of some sort would be a bonus.
>
> People offhandedly have mentioned the X series but it genuinely fits your description perfectly.
>
> I'd recommend either X3: AP or X4 Foundations.
>
> I must warn you though, it has an insane learning curve. With that said, the community is super friendly and helpful and there's many resources to help you.

> > People seems to point towards X3 series instead of X Rebirth.

> Rebirth was a significant departure from the original games, hence the name. It was supposed to be a 'rebirth' of the franchise but it didn't quite work out that way.
>
> It's so different fans of the original games running up to X3 weren't all that impressed with the limitations. But considering your request it might be worth checking out.
>
> X3 is really open, you can even make your own production empire and employ traders and patrols. The sectors are simulated and there are actual ships trading actual goods between stations to keep the production running, you literally can observe the market and find holes for you. Or be a pirate and steal from the transports, or be a privateer for one faction against the other, or be a mercenary etc etc.
>
> You can buy all kinds of ships and weapons from 1 person scouts to vast battleships and carriers and you can fly them all yourself.
>
> Rebirth is much simpler, you can only fly your one ship and the trade is mostly simple buy low sell high, it doesnt run as well and has a console UI, it was meant to be released on consoles but the console companies refused it because it was too shit. They fixed it some, but its still limited.
>
> So X Rebirth maybe if you want something more simple or X3 for the real deal that is harder to get into though.

> X3 games are quite a lot more complex than freelancer.

> X3 has to be one of the best space sims I've played so I definitely recommend it. Having said that it doesn't have the easiest learning curve - the UI is compised of multiple nested menus that take a bit of time to learn your way around. And once you start getting to setting up trade fleets and you own factories you'll be looking up guides for sure.
>
> But at the start of the game it's pretty easy to start flying and shooting, I played X3:Terran conflict and following the story missions gets you set up rather nicely with equipment. The story is pretty good (but having not played any of the previous games I had to look up the previous events to understand what was going on and why) and the end game turns into industry empire building in space!

> Yeah there is a steep learning curve in the X series and the interface is spaghetti, but if you can soldier past that they are very rewarding games.
>
> X Rebirth, I have yet to play.. but from what I've read it was poorly received at launch because it was a buggy mess and lacked the depth of previous titles. That said, Egosoft do a stellar job supporting their games and have released several major patches since, one just a few months ago (inc free dlc).

Elite: Dangerous. There are a lot of recommendations on the [Vive subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/979vj5/any_space_sim_recommendations/).

> Elite: Dangerous is a free form space sim where you fly ships around, do jobs, and earn money. Basically the same premise as Elite, but with a much more intuitive interface and much better flight controls. Very similar to the Evochron games mentioned.

> The modern remake of Elite. Kind of a hybrid between X's water-space flight and a true Newtonian space sim, I'd say this is probably the one for newcomers to space sims if they want a fun and total experience.

> > Looking for an immersive space sim with lots to do, explore, and trade. Lots of NPCs to talk to and a story of some sort would be a bonus.
>
> Elite: Dangerous is fantastic. too hard for me personally as I'm currently lost somewhere around the starting system with 4 hours of fuel and don't have the slightest idea what to do.
>
> Also, there's X series and Everspace, both I think have the stuff you're looking for.

> For just flying around Elite Dangerous is pretty decent. Nice visuals and sound. For content, not so much no.

> Elite: Dangerous - Huge. Just absolutely huge. Combat can be frantic but what it lacks in setup it more than makes up for in mechanics. Space combat sim junkies dream. The variety of ships and play styles help keep PvP from getting too stagnant.
>
> > The flight model in E:D is great, but the weapon balance is pretty poor, which does make the combat a little samey. I hope they do a balance pass sooner than later.
> >
> > > Agreed. No question.
> > >
> > > One thing I *like* about that is, once you learn the system and get the best, it's all about strategy, teamwork, and straight up stick skills.
> > >
> > > On the other hand I don't think the Devs should continue to rely on that as a mechanic. Hopefully they'll tweak weapons to bring them into balance (or introduce new ones...!).
>
> > Elite dangerous has pretty sluggish and poor space combat, its one of the things that has kinda turned me off of the game.

> Elite: Dangerous - 6DOF with restrictions so that you actually have to think about your maneuvering, works well for me.

Rebel Galaxy.

> Rebel Galaxy is fun, and there's a better one coming out soon, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw.

> Rebel Galaxy. A space trucking game with a rippin soundtrack (or custom ones) and Assassin Creed ship combat. Really easy to get into. It's not a 3d movement game so all action takes place on a 2d plane, but still looks good and is fun. Made by a small team.

> Rebel Galaxy - Capital Ships. Think submarine/battleship combat in space. Very strategic and much more immersive than you might think given the third person perspective. There have been lots of games that've taken this approach and I'd claim this one does it best.

Evochron Legacy.

> On the other end of the spectrum you have games like **Evochron Legacy** and **Arvoch Alliance**, which, IMHO, are the only two space combat sims that actually <u>do Newtonian physics even close to fun</u>. These games are complex and a little obtuse, but have a charm that is unmatched by any other game. [I made a fairly recent vid showing some gameplay from Evochron Legacy](https://youtu.be/feICTnthipg).

> **Evochron Legacy**
> This is a spaceflight sim game with Newtonian physics, all programmed by one guy, and it's pretty impressive. Be a space trucker and fly around the galaxy doing missions.

Space Rangers HD: A War Apart.

Wing Commander: Privateer.

> This is probably one of the older examples, but Wing Commander: Privateer. You fly around trading and upgrading your ship. You can be attacked by pirates or play as one, smuggle goods, or just do cargo runs. There is a main story to complete.
>
> I haven't actually played many of the Wing Commander games (the first definitely and Privateer). The later ones have FMV and Mark Hamill.
>
> Flightsticks are generally the best way to play them.

Others: Oolite, Starpoint Gemini 2, Starpoint Gemini Warlords, X Rebirth, Starsector, Star Traders: Frontiers, 3030 Deathwar Redux, Endless Sky, Star Control 2.

> Oolite is an open GL re-rendering of Elite. And it's surprisingly engaging even after 30 years. It's also free. Give that a go?

> Starsector has the best space combat for me. I've played most spacesims, 3d, 2d, nothing else is as good as leading a fleet into battle and controlling the units. Movement has feel to it, inertia, mass.. but not ridiculous like asteroids. Weapons are punchy, satisfying..
>
> All that and it's got retro 2d top-down graphics! O_o

> There are a lot of different little things going on in Star Traders, but it has a great trading system, which is the kind of game that I want to play. Honestly, the ship to ship combat got pretty boring after like 4 battles, but its not too terrible. It is also on IOS and Android if you want to play it on the go.

> Maybe not exactly what you want, but there's also Star Control 2 (released for free as The Ur-quan Masters). It's a top-down 2D game, but it's a lot of fun talking to aliens and trading for technology.

> **Just for fun**
