## Fightings

Here are the best fightings according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/8aodlb/best_fighting_games_of_all_time/):

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 (the worst is 1, the 3rd one is slightly bad than the 2nd one). Street Fighter Alpha II is a different series than the Street Fighter II games. The Alpha series is quite good and a lot more varied than SF2 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/61wbxe/best_version_of_sfii/).

  > SF 2 is the most important game in the series and is the mort important game in the genre. Nonetheless, people say Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the best in the series.

- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is the best version of Street Fighter 2 (nonetheless, some people say that ST 2: Turbo is better than Super Turbo - e.g. audio). The best ways to play this game are through Hyper Street Fighter 2 for PS 2, Ultra SFII for the Switch, and the 30th Anniversary Collection for PS 3 and XBOX 360 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7r0n54/what_is_the_difference_between_all_the_street/).

- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the most hyped game in the series.

- What about modern SF? Ultra Street Figher lV is the most balanced because of patches. Nonetheless, SF V is more alive game than USF4.

- X-Men Children of the Atom was very innovative, gave birth to the Marvel / Capcom games which not only popularized the tag system and the crossovers, but also created a new genre with exaggerated super powers, high jumps and easy combos which we will later see in games like Guilty Gear and similar. Marvel vs Capcom 2: probably the best MvC ever made. Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 if we want modern version.

- Tekken 3 is the best fighting of PS One epoch, Tekken 7 is currently the best in the series in terms of the gameplay and the novelty. Also, Tekken 7 is the best fighting to get into online.

- Dragon Ball series: 

  - FighterZ is objectively the best fighting game because it's designed to actually be competitive and the art/animation is freaking beautiful, but they focused more on competitive online multiplayer instead of a lengthy storymode full of unlockable characters.
  - Budokai 3 and then Tenkaichi 3. Budokai 3 was great for fast action and feeling like a very DBZish fighting game, also had a good amount of unlockables and the story stuff was quite neat because of hsow you could go back and play through it again while making changes that would lead to fighting folks like Broly or so on. Tenkaichi 3 was good primarily because of its roster size which was unrivaled at the time, not to mention characters had transformations/etc. that could be pulled off mid-match (and most of the Saiyans could transform into Great Ape forms if there was a full moon on that stage). Tenkaichi 3 has the downside in copy-paste of the many characters.

  > If you're looking for strictly a fighting game, FighterZ wins hands down. Budokai 3 is superior though if you aren't looking to play online competitive multiplayer and want to dig through story content with a lot of things to unlock.

- Soulcalibur 2.

- Mortal Kombat 9 (sometimes MK 11 or just MK).

- The others would be Super Smash Brother Melee and Super Smash Bros 64 (according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/459z3g/what_is_the_best_fighting_game_ever/?sort=top).

## Hack 'n' Slash (character action games)

- Devil May Cry:

  > But 1, 3, and 5 are all mast erpieces. 4 is just another solid game in comparison.

  - DMC5: Mechanically the best game in the series.
  - DMC3 (with 2): was genre defining, had the best story, perfect representation of the series.
  - DMC1: literally create a genre (Character action games or, to be more precise, Character Hack 'n' Slash games).
  - DMC4 - Aged better in terms of story and gameplay. Hated the fact it was rushed. 3 to 4 added onto the incredible combat and made it even more nuts. Some players over rate 4 because it was their first and that makes total and complete sense. But it has never been the best. Middle of the road game. And that's still a good thing because the DMC series is generally great.
  - DmC - Gameplay wise it's extremely fun, it just bastardizes everything else.
  - DMC2 - Ehhhh.

- Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.

- NieR:Automata.

- Ninja Gaiden Black + 2.

- Onimusha (PS2) series isn't 'pure' hack-and-slash but still has some cool melee stuff going on (and moreso as the series progressed).

- Bayonetta 2. It's just so well put together and satisfying to play.



## Immersive Sims

Many things were taken from this [source](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313302/7_influential_immersive_sims_that_all_devs_should_play.php):

- System Shock 2 - an RPG-influenced, twisted horror playground. The systems-heavy interactivity and freedom at the core of immersive sims can just as easily be used to stifle and undermine as to liberate and empower, if paired with smart writing.
- Thief 1 & 2 - narrow-but-deep expression of the genre. Less is often more in game design; by focusing on a smaller set of ideas, systems, and verbs, Thief establishes a world dripping with detail and carefully designed around physicality — space, sound, light, dark, and movement bring depth to its relatively simple set of mechanics.
- Deus Ex - broad ambition, flexible systems, and varying situations. Consistency does not mean always offering a full suite of options, or even necessarily allowing the same solutions to always work; rather, it's in following the rules of the world, and if you're smart about it it could involve setting expectations that experimentation will be rewarded more so than rote behavior.
- TES Morrowind - occasionally.
- Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines - a flawed but brilliant study of power fantasies. Artful use of scripting can configure and reconfigure player expectations, even in games that prize player freedom and emergence.
- Pathologic.
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
- Bioshock + second DLC of Bioshock Infinite.
- Deus Ex: Human Revolution.
- Dishonored 1 & 2 - seamless possibility spaces meet masterful world building. Giving players full agency to play how they want takes two key design considerations: on the one hand, a diverse, inventive suite of tools and verbs, and on the other smart level design that allows freedom to solve problems in any way the player can imagine.
- Prey.
- Arx Fatalis - an immersive RPG. The beating heart of an immersive sim is its world — make that feel tangible and rewarding to simply exist in and you'll have achieved much of the central ideal of the genre: the sense of immersion in one's virtual surroundings.
- Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
- My Summer Car - the future of immersive sims. Immersive sims don't need to have sci fi or fantasy themes; they can be set just as easily in the life of an unextraordinary person in decidedly ordinary circumstances.

Some other games have Immersive Sim components too: Hitman Blood Money (with 1st person), Metal Gear Solid V (with its AI system), Fallout New Vegas (with its 1st person view and hardcore mode).

> An immersive sim can be anything so long as it's consistent and reactive and its world feels alive.

## Metroidvania

### Castelvania

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/96ldav/what_are_the_essential_castlevania_games_that_i/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/8ehgo1/what_are_your_personal_top_10_castlevania_games/):

- Castlevania 4: Symphony of the Night - revived the series and spawned a new genre known as Metroidvania games. Players assume the role of Alucard, as you explore Dracula’s Castle in order to find and defeat him. No longer are whips the weapon of choice, as swords and shields have taken over, along with magic and and the ability to transform into mist, wolves and bats. Explore the beautifully-detailed non-linear castle – right side up or inverted.
- Rondo of Blood - probably the best game in the entire series
- Aria of Sorrow - one of the best stories and gameplay.

### Metroid

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1rwsx8/how_would_you_rank_the_games_best_to_worst/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/9gcby0/what_are_your_top_5_metroid_games/):

- Super Metroid.
- Metroid: Prime (some people say that Prime 2 is better than the first one because it is more polished).

## Platforms

### Donkey Kong

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6vcx5r/whats_your_favorite_donkey_kong_game_from_the/):

- Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.
- Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.

### Mario

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6a080g/super_mario_games_what_are_your_alltime_rankings/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7y3sjd/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mario_game_and_why/?sort=top):

- Super Mario World is still the best among the 2D games.
- Super Mario Bros. 3.
- Super Mario 64 - It was a super creative transition into 3D gaming.
- The others would be Galaxy 1 and 2 (the second is slightly better than the first one but both are the best among 3D), classic Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Odyssey.

### Mega Man

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9l4jgs/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_in_2018/?sort=top), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/9mlkkp/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_out_of_the_entire/?sort=top), [Reddit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/aahasi/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mega_man_game/), and [Reddit 4](reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/8tlvvq/is_it_worth_playing_every_megaman_game/?sort=top):

>Most of the series is pretty redundant. I’d say start at Mega Man 2, 7, X and X4.

- **Mega Man 2** and Mega Man 3 are wildly considered the best of the original series (especially 2). I tried them and must admit that they have annoying backgrounds. Don't pick 3 to start with. It's a good game but it's Incredibly hard and Longer than the other classic games. Also among them, people still distinguish Mega Man 7 (how many of them :().

- **Mega Man X** is the best of the X series. The original Mega Man X was remade on the PlayStation Portable as Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X. On December 21, 2011, another remake of Mega Man X was released for download on the iPhone and iPad. X2 and X4 are good too, but someone thinks X4 is *the* best in that series and in the franchise as a whole.

  > If you like X, then I highly recomment X2 - 4 as well (4 has some terrible voice work, but also some fantastic gameplay.)

- Mega Man Zero is the hardest Mega Man series, the gameplay is similar to X but more fast and fluid, it has a very interesting plot and a conclusion, the music is top tier. 1 and 2 are especially worth it. Mega Man Zero 3 for story. 

### Sonic

Classic:

- Sonic the Hedgehog 1
- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - Sega’s answer to Mario, Sonic arrive to to carry the Genesis brand name. While the original Sonic and its second sequel, Sonic 3, were fantastic games in their own right, the blue Hedgehog’s best adventure was his second go-around. Dazzling speed with beautifully rich and colourful levels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 pits the titular character and his companion Tails against the evil Dr. Robotnik. Make sure to collect enough rings to enter the special stages, allowing you to transform into Super Sonic.

## Role-playing games

### Chrono Trigger

Mixing epic RPG action and time travel, Chrono Trigger is one of the best and most popular games on the SNES as well as one of the greatest RPG’s of all time. With a complex story revolving around your group of heroes jumping from one time period to the next trying to stop the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger presented amazing aesthetics, a fantastic musical score, endearing characters, an innovative battle system, multiple endings and even a major character’s death – we won’t say who, but it was unheard of at the time.

### Ni no Kuni

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

- Ni no Kuni 1 - the art style is by Studio Ghibli and it is an awesome RPG with some Pokémon like aspects too where you collect and evolve familiars.
- Ni no Kuni 2 is less cool than the first but it has more abilities to build your army.

### The Legend of Zelda

Here are the best The Legend of Zelda games:

- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time. The best way to play this game is through Nintendo 3DS. You can use Citra emulator in order to do this but it isn't that stable. Nonetheless, people say that OoT runs well on this emulator. The other way to play this game is to use the latest Project64 with the [GLideN64](http://www.emucr.com/2016/10/gliden64-git-20161016.html) plugin upscaled and played with true unstretched [widescreen](http://i.imgur.com/EEe7Wrx.jpg), it also supports high res textures [[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/5ajs18/best_way_to_play_emulated_ocarina_of_time_in_2016/?sort=top)].
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

### Persona

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/9mbj87/whats_the_general_consensus_on_best_persona_game/):

- Persona 3 - 5 and 3 are a tie. The story of 3 is better, thematically strong, good characters who all get a fair amount of screen time. Persona 5 is a better **game** but not worth replaying. Persona 3 FES is honestly better than PSP version. 
  P3P has the Female MC option to give you something new to do if you're already done all the social links with the Male MC. Battling is better in P3P since you can control all your party members. Outside battles and dungeons P3P is more of a visual novel style. You don't run around town, you just move a cursor. P3P doesn't have the animated cutscenes. P3P doesn't have the Answer included with it like FES does, but the Answer is boring anyway. The best way to experience it is through youtube for some story-line closure. The best way to play is with P3P while watching the animated cutscenes on youtube.
- Persona 5 and Persona 2. 5 has the worst story but amazing gameplay and characters though they don't get any worthwhile development. Overall, the game is solid tho. 2 has meh gameplay but that story. And all the characters are amazing too.

### Pokemon

After googling I find out that the best Pokémon games (for me) are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region (the first region - classic):

- Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen versions - are the enhanced remakes to the original Japanese Pokémon games (Red and Green) for the Game Boy Advance. While Fire Red was a remake of Pokémon Red, LeafGreen was a remake of the Japan-only Pokémon Green. Pokémon Green had previously been a Japan exclusive, being replaced by Pokémon Blue in the US. Regardless, the Green remake was chosen for the US editions [[WIKI]([https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pokémon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen))]. Yeah, this is hard!!! :laughing:
- Other great Pokémon games are Pokémon HeartGold/ SoulSilver.

## Strategies

- Heroes of Might & Magic 3.

- Anno 1404 and then Anno 2070 (feels like an ultra-polished version of 1404). Nice comments are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/andnkq/how_would_you_rank_all_the_anno_games_and_why/). Some people say that Anno 1800 is actually pretty good and can be a nice modern Anno experience.

- Civilization 4 (maybe with DLC, maybe without them.) and then Civilization 5 (with expansions!) - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/35wfzm/what_are_your_top_5_strategy_games_of_all_time/).

- Age of Empires 2.

- Rome: Total War and then Medieval II: Total War.

- World in Conflict. 

  > This is one of the few games I kept playing for its story. It assumes that the cold war got hot and the Soviet Union invaded the USA. At first this sounds kinda cliché and dull imo, but it was very well presented and actually thrilling to see how things unfold.

- Command & Conquer: Red Alert and Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn.

- Starcraft 1-2. Some people say Warcraft (especially the 3rd one) > Starcraft.

- Age of Mythology - my own first strategy video game <3
