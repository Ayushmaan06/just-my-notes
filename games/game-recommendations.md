## Fightings

Here are the best fightings according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/8aodlb/best_fighting_games_of_all_time/):

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 (the worst is 1, the 3rd one is slightly bad than the 2nd one). Street Fighter Alpha II is a different series than the Street Fighter II games. The Alpha series is quite good and a lot more varied than SF2 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/61wbxe/best_version_of_sfii/).
- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is the best version of Street Fighter 2 (nonetheless, some people say that ST 2: Turbo is better than Super Turbo - e.g. audio). The best ways to play this game are through Hyper Street Fighter 2 for PS 2, Ultra SFII for the Switch, and the 30th Anniversary Collection for PS 3 and XBOX 360 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7r0n54/what_is_the_difference_between_all_the_street/).
- Tekken 3.
- Soulcalibur 2.

## Role-playing games

### The Legend of Zelda

Here are the best The Legend of Zelda games:

- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time.
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

### Pokemon

After googling I find out that the best Pokémon games (for me) are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region (the first region - classic):

- Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen versions - are the enhanced remakes to the original Japanese Pokémon games (Red and Green) for the Game Boy Advance. While Fire Red was a remake of Pokémon Red, LeafGreen was a remake of the Japan-only Pokémon Green. Pokémon Green had previously been a Japan exclusive, being replaced by Pokémon Blue in the US. Regardless, the Green remake was chosen for the US editions [[WIKI]([https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pokémon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen))]. Yeah, this is hard!!! :laughing:

Other great Pokémon games are Pokémon HeartGold/ SoulSilver.
