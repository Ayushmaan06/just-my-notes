# Source port in doom

## Source port term

A source port is a port of the source code for the Doom engine. The term usually denotes a modification made by fans, as opposed to any of the officially licensed versions produced by id Software or affiliated companies.

The Doom source code was released to the public on December 23, 1997. Although Doom was originally created for DOS, the release was of the Linux version, and the source code had to be ported back to DOS and to other operating systems. Hence the term "source port", which out of custom also is used for those modifications which are not technically ports to another platform. The term itself originates from the first source port, DOSDoom and its 0.2 version.

Source ports have been created for a variety of PC operating systems, such as the 32-bit Windows family, Linux and the BSDs. By abstracting away the x86-specific code, ports have also been created for a large variety of other hardware platforms: PowerPC/Macintosh; the Game Park 32, a Korean hand-held; the Nokia 7650 and 9210 cell phones; the Sega Dreamcast; and any POSIX environment with the X windowing system.

The original purpose of source ports was cross-platform compatibility, but shortly after the release of the source code, programmers were correcting old, unaddressed Doom bugs and deficiencies in their own source ports, and later began adding new features to alter gameplay.

> Some source ports that preserve the 'vanilla' qualities of the 1993 originals:
>
> Chocolate Doom: https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom
>
> Doom Retro: http://www.doomretro.com/ (an only slightly more 'enhanced' variant of Chocolate Doom)
>
> > 4: As source port I'd recommend the most popular one: GZdoom. Offers the most graphical enhancements and features and works best if you want to get into custom wads and mods
> >
> > > 1: I am a fan of chocolate doom. Its the way I remember playing it as a kid and really turns up the nostalgia factor.

> 4: There's some explaining to do first OP. So technically Doom is free, but all it really is - is the engine plus the first chapter of the game. You have to buy it somewhere like GOG or Steam to get the full thing - but once you get it you will have a better expierience getting a <u>sourceport</u> to run the game instead of the default dosbox steam tries to have you use.
>
> What I did was I bought a bundle on Steam, installed the games, and copied the .WAD files in my steam directory the games were in. I pasted the wads somewhere else and installed chocolate doom to run the games. It was WAYY better than running it with steam - which uses dosbox.

> 2: GOG. I'm hearing that version is better than Steam, something to with an updated DOSbox or something.
