# Source port in doom

## Source port term

A source port is a port of the source code for the Doom engine. The term usually denotes a modification made by fans, as opposed to any of the officially licensed versions produced by id Software or affiliated companies.

The Doom source code was released to the public on December 23, 1997. Although Doom was originally created for DOS, the release was of the Linux version, and the source code had to be ported back to DOS and to other operating systems. Hence the term "source port", which out of custom also is used for those modifications which are not technically ports to another platform. The term itself originates from the first source port, DOSDoom and its 0.2 version.

Source ports have been created for a variety of PC operating systems, such as the 32-bit Windows family, Linux and the BSDs. By abstracting away the x86-specific code, ports have also been created for a large variety of other hardware platforms: PowerPC/Macintosh; the Game Park 32, a Korean hand-held; the Nokia 7650 and 9210 cell phones; the Sega Dreamcast; and any POSIX environment with the X windowing system.

The original purpose of source ports was cross-platform compatibility, but shortly after the release of the source code, programmers were correcting old, unaddressed Doom bugs and deficiencies in their own source ports, and later began adding new features to alter gameplay.

> ***Name with bold and italic*** means that this port is highly recommended by players (see the paragraph below). Plus, in the same way I highlighted the word ***Yes*** for the same ports, but which have full Linux support.

## Which Doom should I buy and what port should I use

Some source ports that preserve the 'vanilla' qualities of the 1993 originals:

***Chocolate Doom***: https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom

Doom Retro: http://www.doomretro.com/ (an only slightly more 'enhanced' variant of Chocolate Doom)

> As source port I'd recommend the most popular one: ***GZdoom***. Offers the most graphical enhancements and features and works best if you want to get into custom wads and mods
>
> > I am a fan of chocolate doom. Its the way I remember playing it as a kid and really turns up the nostalgia factor.

There's some explaining to do first OP. So technically Doom is free, but all it really is - is the engine plus the first chapter of the game. You have to buy it somewhere like GOG or Steam to get the full thing - but once you get it you will have a better experience getting a <u>sourceport</u> to run the game instead of the default dosbox steam tries to have you use.

What I did was I bought a bundle on Steam, installed the games, and copied the .WAD files in my steam directory the games were in. I pasted the wads somewhere else and installed ***chocolate doom*** to run the games. It was WAY better than running it with steam - which uses dosbox.

<u>GOG. I'm hearing that version is better than Steam</u>, something to with an updated DOSbox or something.

Doom 2

Man you can find the Wads with 10 seconds of googling. Use ***GZdoom*** with the Wads. The steam version is absolute buggy garbage. If you feel ethically iffy on it, go get the Wads from steam and then play it using zdoom. The dosbox port on steam is just terrible.

Zdoom: https://zdoom.org/downloads (GZdoom here)

Original doom wads: http://www.pc-freak.net/blog/doom-1-doom-2-doom-3-game-wad-files-for-download-playing-doom-on-debian-linux-via-freedoom-open-source-doom-engine/

> ZDoom is outdated. If you don't want GZDoom's OpenGL renderer you should get ***GZDoom*** anyway and run it in software mode. It's basicly ZDoom but more updated.

- The classic collection on Steam or GOG has Ultimate Doom (First game with an additional fourth episode), Doom 2 (Which may have the Master Levels) and Final Doom (Two 32 maps episodes, which are a bit more difficult and not as enjoyed as the main two games).
- Most people play Doom with source ports and there's a lot of them for Doom games.
- ***Chocolate Doom*** is the most faithfull one, while Crispy Doom is like a slighty "friendlier" version of Choco.
- PrBoom and PrBoom+ work as vanilla source ports with some additions. I think the latter can play maps that are still vanilla but have lots of enemies if i'm right.
- ***GZDoom*** is for gameplay mods, advanced modding projects and has a lot of settings and features. It's more advanced than other source ports but it's not as faithful (Either due to some default settings or outright changes), some of its default settings are kinda bad (You can change them if you can browse the options menus) and can be a bit heavy on certain hardware (Which means PrBoom+ can handle huge maps better, if i got that right).
- Zandronum is also mod focused but for multiplayer.
- ZDL is a launcher that allows you to set up orders for which content you want to play (Such as a mapset, then one or two gameplay mods after it). Normally, you put the maps/wads before the gameplay changing stuff, while selecting a specific IWAD, that the map/mapset/wad is made for.
- IWADS (As in, the games themselves like Doom 1, 2 etc) should be in the same folder as your chosen source port but source ports themselves should be on seperate folders. (Which means you may have to copy+paste the IWADS into each seperate folder)
- To get mods or wads, you can check sites like Doomworld's idgames, ZDoom forums, ModDb or maybe simply google mod related stuff and see if a forum thread or video description have a download link. Doom modding/mapping is big enough that there's a lot of places to get that content.
- Doom 64 has its own source port, which is Doom 64 EX, but it requires a Nintendo 64 ROM of the game.
- If you want to play Doom 3 (And its expansion Resurrection of Evil), you could see the original game and its expansion and mix them with the duct tape mod, if you're worried about the changes in the BFG edition.

I tried to add as much info as possible and someone once made a Doom guide, so i hope this one can work too.

Doom 1 levels are more fun, but Doom 2 is more interesting to look at

> Most mods are made for Doom 2. Some are made forr Plutonia / TNT.
> I'd say buy Buy "Doom Classic Complete" on Steam. Plutonia is really cool (you don't have to start on UV or HMP), and you get all the official Classic Doom that ever was.

> > Plutonia is for thou who are worthy. Much harder puzzles, reminds me of Thy Flesh Consumed if it was a map-pack.

DOOM Ultimate and DOOM 2

And then I'd recommend using ***gzdoom***. It ports the game to a new engine:

- High resolution support
- Filtered textures (if you want, I don't like them)
- Opengl support so you can use your mouse to look the full 360 up and down without the game stretching to oblivion and back
- Jumping (disable it if you are playing non-community maps, it breaks classic maps)
- New lighting/particle effects for barrels, torches, lava, rockets, bullets, gun flashes
- And the best part is it's ultra-customizable with menu's to get lost in, tweaking to your hearts desire to make it perfect

I highly recommend it unless you want to play it *purist*

Let me see if i can remember some features of the ***GZdoom***:

- Props like trees and lamps can block projectiles.
- The wallrun glitch that lets you outrun rockets is fixed, which means maps made for it won't work (Doesn't apply to the official games).
- Filters are on.
- Some maps may look too dark because of the lightning settings.
- The light amplification visor has a night vision filter instead of simply brightning up rooms.
- The automap has different colors.
- There's a secret notifier, which is a text that shows up and says you found a secret, but it's not really a bad thing unless it affects your preformance.
- I think there's autosave on.
- The scaling of the HUD may be a bit off.

I'm probably missing more, but then there's stuff like the windowed mode, mouse not being activated on menus and the default controlls which are less to do with being faithfull and are just weird decisions."

***GZDoom*** is great for modding and such, because that's its main purpose as a source port.

Ultimate Doom and Doom 2, play them through ***GZDoom*** for an authentic but modern experience. Then move on to the new DOOM if you liked the first 2. I wouldn't bother with 3, except the BFG Edition.

Ultimate Doom: this is Doom 1 with the later added and quite hard 4th episode.

Doom 2: Well, it's Doom 2. Get this one as most mods require it.

Final Doom: this are two comercial community wads. TNT and Plutonia. Not really worth buying as there are better mods out there and Plutonia is kinda annoying with it's chaingunners.

Master levels for Doom: a bunch of single maps made by some community members. Not worth buying at all, just download mods and you will have a better experience.

***GZDoom*** (not ZDoom) is one of the best sourceports and has the best mod compability, so play with that

> Eh? Nothing to say about TNT? TNT is actually pretty good, imo. Not too hard puzzles, not too many monsters to deal with..But plutonia was fucking hard as hell

---

DOOM II introduces the super shotgun and several new monsters, and it's required for most custom maps and mods nowadays.

---

Doom 1 is easier puzzle wise and has a bit of monsters. There's a good ratio of monsters vs puzzles.

Doom 2 has a bit more puzzles, and has only a little more monsters. It does have some perks, such as not having to switch episodes.

Master levels..I haven't played those. Seriously? 15$? Jesus.

Steam and GOG are the same, but GOG has better support and install on my experience, but, if DOSBox is not for you, them ***Chocolate Doom***, most  source port ruins the experience of vanilla (original DOOM) if not well  configured, but for mods, them pic ***GZDoom***; aside of nerve.wad on D3 BFG, there's no reason for playing Classic Doom on it, the Classic Doom  Engine is buggy, is better to take Crispy Doom to play the new expansion (a fork of Chocolate Doom with some tweaks without affecting the  original experience); and for the most complete and easy experience use a tool called wadmoosh, it will fuse all the Classic Doom wads into a sole Doom mod in pk3 format (to be used on GZDoom and forks); For multiplayer focus, use Zandronum. Have a good day~

## Doom source ports and SteamPlay

> I think they mean this [fork](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda).

You can also play GZDoom - a GoldSrc recreation of DOOM - that runs natively via Luxtorpeda. But if you stick with this standard DOSBox version you'll have no issues aside from not being able to Alt+Tab when  fullscreen.

Should be played with GZDoom or Zandronum instead
