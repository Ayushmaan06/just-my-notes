Note: If I had lumped Pandemic and Pandemic: Legacy together, it would have had 27 nominations.

82: Actually, those games are mostly excellent and representative of what's popular on this sub (me: r/boardgames) and BGG. I didn't really notice any really objectionable outliers.

27: Interesting. What’s cool about this method is that it gives runner-up “always the bridesmaid” type of games a chance to shine. I’m curious what a top 3 filter would do to the overall results (assuming people actually placed their answers in rank order).

This also has me thinking I need to pick up *Scythe*...

> 24: I for one regret buying *Scythe*. We‘ve played it twice and nobody had any fun. It‘s a boring game and for the life of me I can‘t see what people find in it.
>
> > 11: I have had a similar problem with it. It was a beautiful gift and I was hoping to love it. It did not go over with either group I play with and the larger expansion board didn't fit any table I brought it to.
> >
> > But it's ok it's not for me, I just wish there was a place we could discuss it without people thinking we were being trolls for not enjoying it.
> >
> > Ultimately, traded it for V-Commandos which I love. Rules took some trying thanks to the rule book, but I love it. Funny story, the guy I traded *Scythe* for looked at everything in my box before agreeing to the trade. He couldn't understand why I would sell a near perfect copy of Scythe for a game with chits, lol.

> 11: You really should. Purchasing it has legitimately saved me money; so many games fell off my wishlist because "Meh, I'd rather just play Scythe."
>
> > 4: I, on the other hand, have bought far too many upgrades, expansions and digital versions of Scythe to be considered reasonable by most, I assume. The cost of the core game has been eclipsed a few times over but I'll be damned if I haven't felt it was worth it.
> >
> > 5: I wish all disagreement on the internet worked like this. I am playing it for the first time in a week or so. Already intimidated, but in the good way.

25: Because data is beautiful, to examine the feedback of those [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/) users who are able to and volunatrily ranked their favorite games during the time window of a particular thread requesting this data, I'll expound by looking at the nominations by year (for those interested).

|     10      |          Mage Knight           | 2011 |
|     10      |     *Magic: The Gathering*     | 1993 |
|     10      |      Roll for the Galaxy       | 2014 |
|     10      |      Tigris and Euphrates      | 1997 |

NOTES:

- No Twilight Imperium edition listed. 1-4 editions release years: 1997, 2000, 2005, 2017
- Viticulture Essential Edition released in 2015, but it specified with the Tuscany Essential Edition expansion which was released in 2016.
- Cosmic Encounter has 4 different versions not listed on BGG as "editions" but under the same title (at apparently the request of Fantasy Flight Games). The release years are 1977, 1991, 2000, and 2008.
- Pandemic Legacy season not specified in post, but since it had consideration to be lumped in with Pandemic I will assume it is Season 1
- The Resistance: Avalon was released in 2012; it is unclear if this listing combined the two versions or just the Avalon version
- Through the Ages does not specify if it is A Story of Civilization or A New Story of Civilization, these were released respectively in 2006 and 2015
- Battlestar Galactica also has a 1978 and 1979 board game version as well as a CCG from 2006, but I think it is safe to assume people mean only Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game based of the TV show reboot.
- Magic: The Gathering is a game that heavily evolved over the years, and it is impossible what year rule set those that nominated it were thinking of. I am assuming Arena of the Planeswalkers from 2015 was meant when nominating this game.
- Tigris Euphrates has had many different print runs in different languages (Euphrat & Tigris German 1997 edition, 1998 prints in Dutch, 1999 and 2003 aand 2008 Mayfair English editions, 2004 Dutch/French edition, 2007 Russian edition, 2007 Polish edition, 2007 German edition, 2009 Chinese edition, 2009 Matagot French edition, 2014 french edition, and then in 2015 had editions in: Japanese, Italian, German, English, and French)

So about 1/4 are from the last 2 years, 1/3 of the nominated titles were from the last 5 years, and 4/5ths of the titles were from the last decade. However, a word of caution: there has been a phenomenal growth in ~~~~[r/boargames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boargames/)~~~~ [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/) membership and board game hobbyists in general. These results are not necessarily evidence of "Cult of the New" but may be evidence of "New Cultists" (meaning, new players to the hobby who choose to buy games available easily to them rather than older classic titles that might be harder to find or have less shelf appeal... or lower stock numbers in game stores due to having saturated their local market already with the title).

ADDITIONAL NOTE:

Unless there was an obvious change in game mechanisms, I used the earliest date I could find. I am not sure about Twilight Imperium and its changes over editions, but 3rd edition is still over a decade old so even if I used that edition it wouldn't have changed the summary here.

> 13: These results are not necessarily evidence of "Cult of the New" but may be evidence of "New Cultists"
>
> Thank you. And *maybe* also evidence that the top games, on average, are getting better.

19: I'm genuinely surprised that Food Chain Magnate didn't make more than 10 top-5 lists. Definitely in my top-5 (maybe even #1).

> 14: I imagine that, being more difficult to find (relative to many of the other games on this list) + expensive (for the amount of stuff you actually get compared to something like **Gloomhaven**, which, while more expensive than FCM, you get way more in the box), made the game not get as many votes.
>
> Regardless, absolutely a Top 5 for me.

18: Not enough Eclipse on that list :p

15: Seeing *Carcassonne* uo there makes me happy 😁

12: This list has a lot of my favorite games but it's a shame **Troyes** isn't included. It seems that the game is getting talked about less and less. :(

> 6: Every game gets talked about less and less as time goes on. That's what happens when thousands of new games come out every year. Troyes is eight years old. That's pretty old in today's terms.
>
> > 5: Of the ones on the list I'm familiar with, some are much older. *Carcassonne* is 18 years old, *Twilight Imperium* is 21, *Magic: The Gathering* is 24, and Cosmic Encounter is 41 years old.

10: I've never played *Scythe*, but I do remember reading about how everyone thinks *Scythe* is very flawed. But here it is at the top. What gives?

> 23: I think at first some people were disappointed that it was a plodding resource management euro when they were expecting giant mech combat.
>
> I’ve never played, that’s just what I got from discussion I’ve seen here and on bgg.
>
> > 12: And some just think it is a plodding resource management euro, regardless of expectations. It is an argument that is not without merit. The game sells a scale of grandeur that the game does not really deliver.

> 19: Vocal minority. It’s not flawed. It’s just not a war game but instead it’s an efficiency euro. Just have to know what the game is.

> 10: It's detractors don't really hate it though. It's more of a "meh" feeling. Expectations were high, and it didn't match the hype for everyone, but that doesn't mean they think is a bad game.
>
> I'm kinda meh on it myself. It's nothing too amazing for me, but I'll still play it if someone really wants to.

> 10: My theory is that Scythe falls in the middle of a few key categories.
>
> Firstly, the art is just realistic enough to not turn folks away who dislike "cartoony" games and it's just "steampunk" enough to keep the interest of people who would be turned off by games that are very historically focused and "bland". I think this really helps the game appeal at a visual level, a key to getting people interested in playing.
>
> Second, I think it's straight forward enough in its rules to be fairly simple to learn but complex enough in the puzzle it presents players each game that people stay interested in trying it multiple times. Every game that ends with players saying, "I could have got you if I had two more turns!" is a game that will probably be played again. People like to perfect a strategy.
>
> Lastly, while it has some fighting between players to interest competitive minded folks, combat never has you loose progress on your engine building so more non-confrontational players aren't overwhelmed. I know a number of people who don't feel comfortable doing something negative to their opponent and they're OK with Scythe. Also, having someone beat you by breaking your plan also feels bad to a lot of people and can translate to not wanting to play it.
>
> In these ways I think Scythe has something to offer most people and has a lot of appeal to more casual gamers which is a great way to get publicity. As it stands Scythe continues to be my favorite game and has been for a while. I could go on for hours...
>
> 10: The discourse is pretty split. It's beautiful, but there was a controversy about the artist using references. It's got some interesting mechanics, but it's very very Euro-y. It's a world full of really cool steampunk mechs but they don't fight as much as they move farmers around. It hits a lot of sweet spots for some people but also triggers others as overrated.

7: Still not going to try Scythe. I've watched reviews, I've read reviews, I've read comments, and it just doesn't seem like a game I would enjoy! People seem to love it and I wish I could feel what that's like, but I think i'm deep enough in this hobby now to know what itches some of these games are going to scratch.

Honestly, Spirit Island and Terraforming Mars are the same to me. They seem overly fiddly but have done something well enough to get moving on the hype train. I've seen enough criticism of both of them to steer me away for very real issues.

I wonder which of these games, hot this year, will still be talked about and played in a decade, the way Dominion, Twilight Struggle, etc, still live on.

For reference, my top 5 would have been:

Bora Bora Tzolk'in *Android: Netrunner* Castles of Mad King Ludwig Dominant Species

2: The only three I haven't played are Five Tribes, Battlestar Galactica and Viticulture. What am I missing?

> 6: Viticulture is a good game but not particularly unique if you've played other good worker placement games. I like playing it, but unless it falls into that sweet spot of weight for you, I don't think it's required playing.
>
> Five Tribes doesn't feel like any other game I've played, and it's quite good. I think it's worth trying out for just about anybody that likes modern board games.

> 6: BSG is a good hidden traitor game. There's secret bidding towards if each given event succeeds or fails and it can be hard to be sure if someone is actually just out of cards and unable to contribute or if they're intentionally holding back, or if one of the other players screwed you over or if it was the game deck.
>
> The first half of the game tends to be played pretty close to the vest as Cylon players try to subtly hamper the game while humans try to avoid going all-in helping the ship since they might actually be Cylons themselves in the second half; no one's completely sure where their own allegiances lie, much less anyone else. The second half tends to be more aggressive and up-front with Cylons trying to sew discord as they reveal and burn down the ship while the remaining humans race towards the victory and hope they don't run out of resources along the way.
>
> It's actually a really fun game, especially with the right group. Having watched the show is a plus, since it'll make the various references make more sense (such as why certain unique character abilities are what they are for that character), but it's still a solid game in its own right and having watched the show is not at all required to enjoy the game.

1: What's the best head to head games on here?

> 3: I would say Twilight Struggle, *Carcassonne*, Castles of Burgundy, *Race for the Galaxy* are definitely worth it for head to head games. There are a few on the list I haven't played so I can't really speak for those.

## Great Games with Traditional Playing Cards

...

So where should you start? Hopefully some of the descriptions I have provided will intrigue you enough to give a particular game a shot, or look into it further. But often games will depend on who you are playing with, the number of players you have, and the kind of game you are looking for. So to help you branch out beyond the repertoire that you might already be familiar with, here are some recommendations for games that I especially suggest for different situations.

***Are you looking for...***

\- **a game for just two players?** [GOPS](http://www.pagat.com/misc/gops.html) and [Scopa](http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html) are two simpler games that are quite rewarding. If you want a trick-taking game for just two, then [Briscola](http://www.pagat.com/aceten/briscola.html) and [German Whist](https://www.pagat.com/whist/german_whist.html) are both straight forward and good choices, while [Le Truc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truc) is fantastic for those who like bluffing, and [Schnapsen](http://www.pagat.com/marriage/schnaps.html) is worth the effort to learn if you enjoy skilful play. [**Cribbage**](http://www.pagat.com/adders/crib6.html) and [Gin Rummy](http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html) are two non trick-taking classics that are every bit as good today as they have always been.

\- **a game for four-players in partnerships?** There are several good trick-taking games to choose from in this category, and while the ever-popular [Bridge](http://www.pagat.com/boston/bridge.html) is good, the learning curve can be steep. I recommend starting with a simpler game like [Euchre](http://www.pagat.com/euchre/euchre.html) or [Whist](http://www.pagat.com/whist/whist.html), or else something that involves more skill, like [500](http://www.pagat.com/euchre/500.html), [Rook](http://www.pagat.com/kt5/rook.html), or [Spades](http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html), which incorporate the fun of bidding and give opportunity for a winning bidder to strengthen their hand.

\- **a trick-taking game for an odd number of players?** [Ninety-Nine](http://www.pagat.com/exact/99.html) is the best trick-taker that plays with exactly three players. [Hearts](http://www.pagat.com/reverse/hearts.html) and [Oh Hell](http://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html) can both handle various player counts, and are very good; if you enjoy bidding for how many tricks you think you will win then Oh Hell is an absolute must.

\- **a light social game for a larger group?** Try the classic climbing game [President](http://www.pagat.com/climbing/president.html), the almost brainless [Ranter-Go-Round](http://www.pagat.com/cuckoo/cuckoo.html), or the frenzy of [Spoons](http://www.pagat.com/eights/spoons.html), all of which are easy to learn and don not require too much brain power. [Blitz](http://www.pagat.com/draw/scat.html)and [Cheat](http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html) are also good choices for fun social games that can work with more than four players.

\- **a game that is fast-paced?** Try the craziness of two player [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html)/Spit, or else ramp up the difficulty slightly with the frantic game-play of the popular [Nertz](http://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html), both of which have simultaneous real-time game-play. [Egyptian Ratscrew](http://www.pagat.com/war/egyptrat.html) also requires quick reactions and speed.

> [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html) (2-4 players) - Also called "Spit", this a high speed game similar in style to [Nertz](http://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html), but slightly easier and more suitable for children. The aim is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by simultaneously and quickly playing cards of higher or lower value to a common stock.

\- **a game that is unusual and out-of-the-ordinary?** Try the logical deduction required by the clever and inventive [Eleusis](http://www.pagat.com/eights/eleusis.html), or the long and savoury gameplay of [Zetema](https://www.pagat.com/invented/zetema.html).

\- **a game for older children?** Most of the games in the "Social and Family Games" category will work, but fun games that I have had good success with in playing with children include [Cheat](http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html), [Fan Tan](http://www.pagat.com/domino/sevens.html), [Knock Out Whist](http://www.pagat.com/whist/kowhist.html) (which also serves as a good introduction to trick-taking), [Palace](http://www.pagat.com/beating/shithead.html), [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html), and [Spoons](http://www.pagat.com/eights/spoons.html). If they can handle the scoring system, [Scopa](http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html) is definitely a rewarding game that older children can enjoy. [GOPS](http://www.pagat.com/misc/gops.html) produces an excellent head-to-head battle-of-wits for just two.

\- **a game for younger children?** There's a number of classic and very simple games not included on this list, such as [Beggar My Neighbour](https://www.pagat.com/war/beggar_my_neighbour.html) (2-3 players), [Crazy Eights](http://www.pagat.com/eights/crazy8s.html) (2-7 players), [Go Fish](http://www.pagat.com/quartet/gofish.html) (2-6 players), [Old Maid](http://www.pagat.com/passing/oldmaid.html) (2-12 players), [Slap Jack](http://www.pagat.com/war/slapjack.html) (2-8 players), [Snap](https://www.pagat.com/war/snap.html) (2-4 players), and [War](http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html) (2 players). Be aware that some games like Beggar My Neighbour and also War involve no decisions and are a matter of pure luck!

So dust off that deck of playing cards that is looking down expectantly at you from the shelf, invite over some family or friends, and get those playing cards to the table. Enjoy your deck and discover the fun that traditional card games have been bringing people around the world for centuries!

77: This was an absolutely amazing post! Thanks so much for taking the time to do this. It's great to have not only a list of great card games, but a description and a link to learn how to play. Fantastic!

37: Great post!

I also like the card game Golf a lot.

> 10: Seconding golf, especially the 6 card version of it. Good for workplaces, usually even non-gamer people learn it fast and enjoy it. With 6 or more players, we play it with double decks.

23: Egyptian Ratscrew has always been my favorite. The look on people’s faces when you randomly slap into a game of people you don’t know is the best.

14: As a Wisconsinite, I was very happy to see sheepshead on the list. Sheepshead or bust!

10: One game that is obviously missing from the list (as it is very obscure) is Tscbhinquina, a trick-taking game for *five* people and my personal favourite among trick-taking games. It is played 2v3 where the groups themselves are partially hidden information (in the bidding round, a player may call out a card to partner up with whoever holds it). I've written up the rules [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwpauc8QjAKoZ3RaeHFUYzFtQ0k/view?usp=drivesdk), as the only ruleset I could find online was in Romansh.

Also, a shoutout to Tichu, which can *almost* be played with a traditional deck of cards (you need four extra cards, e.g. modified jokers), and is a fantastic shedding game.

10: I also have to mention [Kemps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemps_(card_game)?wprov=sfla1) (also known as Signal, and a million other names). It's a dead-simple real-time game for teams of 2. You can go up to 12 players with a regular deck, though it does get more chaotic as the player count increases.

Goal is to get 4 of a kind by swapping cards in your 4 card hand with the 4 cards face up on the table. There are no turns, just a free for all as cards are revealed. If no one wants to make any more swaps, the face-up cards are trashed and a new 4 are revealed.

The *trick* is that once you get 4 of a kind, your *partner* must shout "Kemps" to claim victory. You can signal them in any way, as long as other players are able to observe it (i.e. no under the table, texting, etc), but it should be secretive because if another player suspects you they can call "Counter-kemps" to eliminate you. Game continues until all but one team has won or been eliminated, and points are awarded for place

Again it's super straightforward, but has a lot of silly emergent gameplay. There is obviously a speed element, but I don't find that slower players are terribly disadvantaged because defense is just as important as offense. In fact 100% defense is even viable, and creates hilarious tension at the table as you just stare everyone down looking for meaningful facial gestures.

5: I have a ton of unique card decks but I never use them anymore because I don’t like the few games that I know. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Crazy 8s, speed, and rummy get old pretty fast. Can’t wait to read these and find the perfect 2 player game.

> 2: It's a perfect way to use custom decks! For two players, I especially love playing German Whist, Scopa, Le Truc, and **Cribbage**.

4: Great resource, thanks!

Happily bookmarked and up voted.

I was also glad to see that **Nertz** made this list. It's one of our favorites.

4: Spades is all you need 👍

## What are your favorite 2 person games? Preferably card games.

62: **Cribbage**. If you want to make it a more skill-based game, less luck-based, deal from the same deck for each hand until you run out of cards.

That is, deal and play the first hand, set those cards aside, deal and play the second hand from the remaining 39 card, set the cards from that hand aside, deal the third hand from the remaining 26 cards, set the cards from that hand aside, deal the last 13 cards. By the time you get to those last 13 cards you should know exactly what your opponent has in her hand. Then start over, with the player who went second going first now.

> 15: We play a lot of **cribbage**. Might have to look into playing it your way, but then I have to pay attention 😋
>
> 7: Definitely Cribbage. I bought a cheap board for $4 and we've played hundreds of games with it. It's fun and perfect for two people to play.

25: Not a card game but check out patchwork. It's one of the more popular 2 player games and easy to get into but still has interesting choices.

Another really fun and popular 2 player game is jaipur, which is a card game.

Codenames duet is the cooperative 2 player version of codenames.

If you have some experience with boardgames or want something more challenging, check out 7 Wonders duel.

Other suggestions: port royal, Forbidden island (cooperative but not a card game), star realms, and lost cities the card game.

If you want more in depth suggestions, there is a wiki and daily recommendations thread in [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/). To find out more about a specific game, check boardgamegeek and maybe watch some videos. The dice Tower usually has a good overview of the rules and game play.

26: Gin Rummy My wife and I lived without internet for a year.

> 8: This is how we passed the time while she was in labor. Still kicked my ass.

> 7: I keep a deck of cards and a notebook in my purse. If the SO and I are out at the bar, we play, and I date our scores. It's fun to look back and see who won what game when and where.

21: I play go. It has a following in China, Korea, and Japan similar to what chess has here. The game is called baduk in Korea, the subreddit is [r/baduk](https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/).

Also chess for that matter. ;-D

Both games are pretty widely played, especially in college towns. Not cards, but among the most popular board games in history.

13: Skipbo!

12: Backgammon! Oh man, it's a lot of fun.

Simple to learn, not so simple to master...plus the randomness of dice!

12: Nerts. It's like multiplayer solitaire. Each person needs their own deck.

11: 13! We always played for money. $.25/card and $2/chop.

It's real name is [Tien Len](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiến_lên), but most English-speaking people call it 13. There are all kinds of variations - most importantly, the three of spades rule.

If you go out on the three of spades as a standalone single, you win bonus money.

If interested, pm and I'll walk you thru it. It's a little much for beginners, unless you really play a lot of card games.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiến_lên

12: I’ve found Fluxx to be pretty fun.

10: Mille Bournes is a really fun card game based on auto racing. You don’t have to care about cars to enjoy it, it’s just a theme. It works for 2 - 6 players and it can be quick if you want it to be, or long if you choose to keep score several hands. Actually some of the scoring and strategy makes more sense in a multihand game.

7: Speed

8: Not a card game but Yahtzee is pretty cheap, takes up little space and is fun with just two players. Every once in a great while my husband and I get in the habit of playing it but usually we play Rummikub[Rummikub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummikub) together. I'm not sure if you want to spend more than a couple bucks on something that takes up space, however. Sorry that neither of my suggestions are card games.

7: Not a card game, but we love to play *Carcassonne*. We got it cheap on Amazon and it + any expansions fit in one smallish box. I think it has a lot of replay value, and I actually think I like it better as 2 player because you get more tiles.

I also love to play poker - more than 2 players is nice, but I've played countless hours with just one other person. There is also chess, checkers , etc. In fact, a lot of places sell a 15 or 20 in one set with a decent variety of classic board games in one box.
