- Mage Knight - 10
- *Magic: The Gathering* - 10
- *Roll for the Galaxy*  - 10
- Tigris and Euphrates - 10

Note: If I had lumped Pandemic and Pandemic: Legacy together, it would have had 27 nominations.

82: Actually, those games are mostly excellent and representative of what's popular on this sub (me: r/boardgames) and BGG. I didn't really notice any really objectionable outliers.

27: Interesting. What’s cool about this method is that it gives runner-up “always the bridesmaid” type of games a chance to shine. I’m curious what a top 3 filter would do to the overall results (assuming people actually placed their answers in rank order).

This also has me thinking I need to pick up *Scythe*...

> 24: I for one regret buying *Scythe*. We‘ve played it twice and nobody had any fun. It‘s a boring game and for the life of me I can‘t see what people find in it.
>
> > 11: I have had a similar problem with it. It was a beautiful gift and I was hoping to love it. It did not go over with either group I play with and the larger expansion board didn't fit any table I brought it to.
> >
> > But it's ok it's not for me, I just wish there was a place we could discuss it without people thinking we were being trolls for not enjoying it.
> >
> > Ultimately, traded it for V-Commandos which I love. Rules took some trying thanks to the rule book, but I love it. Funny story, the guy I traded *Scythe* for looked at everything in my box before agreeing to the trade. He couldn't understand why I would sell a near perfect copy of Scythe for a game with chits, lol.

> 11: You really should. Purchasing it has legitimately saved me money; so many games fell off my wishlist because "Meh, I'd rather just play Scythe."
>
> > 4: I, on the other hand, have bought far too many upgrades, expansions and digital versions of Scythe to be considered reasonable by most, I assume. The cost of the core game has been eclipsed a few times over but I'll be damned if I haven't felt it was worth it.
> >
> > 5: I wish all disagreement on the internet worked like this. I am playing it for the first time in a week or so. Already intimidated, but in the good way.

25: Because data is beautiful, to examine the feedback of those [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/) users who are able to and volunatrily ranked their favorite games during the time window of a particular thread requesting this data, I'll expound by looking at the nominations by year (for those interested).

|     10      |          Mage Knight           | 2011 |
|     10      |     *Magic: The Gathering*     | 1993 |
|     10      |     *Roll for the Galaxy*      | 2014 |
|     10      |      Tigris and Euphrates      | 1997 |

NOTES:

- No Twilight Imperium edition listed. 1-4 editions release years: 1997, 2000, 2005, 2017
- Viticulture Essential Edition released in 2015, but it specified with the Tuscany Essential Edition expansion which was released in 2016.
- Cosmic Encounter has 4 different versions not listed on BGG as "editions" but under the same title (at apparently the request of Fantasy Flight Games). The release years are 1977, 1991, 2000, and 2008.
- Pandemic Legacy season not specified in post, but since it had consideration to be lumped in with Pandemic I will assume it is Season 1
- The Resistance: Avalon was released in 2012; it is unclear if this listing combined the two versions or just the Avalon version
- Through the Ages does not specify if it is A Story of Civilization or A New Story of Civilization, these were released respectively in 2006 and 2015
- Battlestar Galactica also has a 1978 and 1979 board game version as well as a CCG from 2006, but I think it is safe to assume people mean only Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game based of the TV show reboot.
- Magic: The Gathering is a game that heavily evolved over the years, and it is impossible what year rule set those that nominated it were thinking of. I am assuming Arena of the Planeswalkers from 2015 was meant when nominating this game.
- Tigris Euphrates has had many different print runs in different languages (Euphrat & Tigris German 1997 edition, 1998 prints in Dutch, 1999 and 2003 aand 2008 Mayfair English editions, 2004 Dutch/French edition, 2007 Russian edition, 2007 Polish edition, 2007 German edition, 2009 Chinese edition, 2009 Matagot French edition, 2014 french edition, and then in 2015 had editions in: Japanese, Italian, German, English, and French)

So about 1/4 are from the last 2 years, 1/3 of the nominated titles were from the last 5 years, and 4/5ths of the titles were from the last decade. However, a word of caution: there has been a phenomenal growth in ~~~~[r/boargames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boargames/)~~~~ [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/) membership and board game hobbyists in general. These results are not necessarily evidence of "Cult of the New" but may be evidence of "New Cultists" (meaning, new players to the hobby who choose to buy games available easily to them rather than older classic titles that might be harder to find or have less shelf appeal... or lower stock numbers in game stores due to having saturated their local market already with the title).

ADDITIONAL NOTE:

Unless there was an obvious change in game mechanisms, I used the earliest date I could find. I am not sure about Twilight Imperium and its changes over editions, but 3rd edition is still over a decade old so even if I used that edition it wouldn't have changed the summary here.

> 13: These results are not necessarily evidence of "Cult of the New" but may be evidence of "New Cultists"
>
> Thank you. And *maybe* also evidence that the top games, on average, are getting better.

19: I'm genuinely surprised that Food Chain Magnate didn't make more than 10 top-5 lists. Definitely in my top-5 (maybe even #1).

> 14: I imagine that, being more difficult to find (relative to many of the other games on this list) + expensive (for the amount of stuff you actually get compared to something like **Gloomhaven**, which, while more expensive than FCM, you get way more in the box), made the game not get as many votes.
>
> Regardless, absolutely a Top 5 for me.

18: Not enough Eclipse on that list :p

15: Seeing *Carcassonne* uo there makes me happy 😁

12: This list has a lot of my favorite games but it's a shame **Troyes** isn't included. It seems that the game is getting talked about less and less. :(

> 6: Every game gets talked about less and less as time goes on. That's what happens when thousands of new games come out every year. Troyes is eight years old. That's pretty old in today's terms.
>
> > 5: Of the ones on the list I'm familiar with, some are much older. *Carcassonne* is 18 years old, *Twilight Imperium* is 21, *Magic: The Gathering* is 24, and Cosmic Encounter is 41 years old.

10: I've never played *Scythe*, but I do remember reading about how everyone thinks *Scythe* is very flawed. But here it is at the top. What gives?

> 23: I think at first some people were disappointed that it was a plodding resource management euro when they were expecting giant mech combat.
>
> I’ve never played, that’s just what I got from discussion I’ve seen here and on bgg.
>
> > 12: And some just think it is a plodding resource management euro, regardless of expectations. It is an argument that is not without merit. The game sells a scale of grandeur that the game does not really deliver.

> 19: Vocal minority. It’s not flawed. It’s just not a war game but instead it’s an efficiency euro. Just have to know what the game is.

> 10: It's detractors don't really hate it though. It's more of a "meh" feeling. Expectations were high, and it didn't match the hype for everyone, but that doesn't mean they think is a bad game.
>
> I'm kinda meh on it myself. It's nothing too amazing for me, but I'll still play it if someone really wants to.

> 10: My theory is that Scythe falls in the middle of a few key categories.
>
> Firstly, the art is just realistic enough to not turn folks away who dislike "cartoony" games and it's just "steampunk" enough to keep the interest of people who would be turned off by games that are very historically focused and "bland". I think this really helps the game appeal at a visual level, a key to getting people interested in playing.
>
> Second, I think it's straight forward enough in its rules to be fairly simple to learn but complex enough in the puzzle it presents players each game that people stay interested in trying it multiple times. Every game that ends with players saying, "I could have got you if I had two more turns!" is a game that will probably be played again. People like to perfect a strategy.
>
> Lastly, while it has some fighting between players to interest competitive minded folks, combat never has you loose progress on your engine building so more non-confrontational players aren't overwhelmed. I know a number of people who don't feel comfortable doing something negative to their opponent and they're OK with Scythe. Also, having someone beat you by breaking your plan also feels bad to a lot of people and can translate to not wanting to play it.
>
> In these ways I think Scythe has something to offer most people and has a lot of appeal to more casual gamers which is a great way to get publicity. As it stands Scythe continues to be my favorite game and has been for a while. I could go on for hours...
>
> 10: The discourse is pretty split. It's beautiful, but there was a controversy about the artist using references. It's got some interesting mechanics, but it's very very Euro-y. It's a world full of really cool steampunk mechs but they don't fight as much as they move farmers around. It hits a lot of sweet spots for some people but also triggers others as overrated.

7: Still not going to try Scythe. I've watched reviews, I've read reviews, I've read comments, and it just doesn't seem like a game I would enjoy! People seem to love it and I wish I could feel what that's like, but I think i'm deep enough in this hobby now to know what itches some of these games are going to scratch.

Honestly, Spirit Island and Terraforming Mars are the same to me. They seem overly fiddly but have done something well enough to get moving on the hype train. I've seen enough criticism of both of them to steer me away for very real issues.

I wonder which of these games, hot this year, will still be talked about and played in a decade, the way **Dominion**, *Twilight Struggle*, etc, still live on.

For reference, my top 5 would have been:

Bora Bora Tzolk'in *Android: Netrunner* Castles of Mad King Ludwig Dominant Species

2: The only three I haven't played are Five Tribes, Battlestar Galactica and Viticulture. What am I missing?

> 6: Viticulture is a good game but not particularly unique if you've played other good worker placement games. I like playing it, but unless it falls into that sweet spot of weight for you, I don't think it's required playing.
>
> Five Tribes doesn't feel like any other game I've played, and it's quite good. I think it's worth trying out for just about anybody that likes modern board games.

> 6: BSG is a good hidden traitor game. There's secret bidding towards if each given event succeeds or fails and it can be hard to be sure if someone is actually just out of cards and unable to contribute or if they're intentionally holding back, or if one of the other players screwed you over or if it was the game deck.
>
> The first half of the game tends to be played pretty close to the vest as Cylon players try to subtly hamper the game while humans try to avoid going all-in helping the ship since they might actually be Cylons themselves in the second half; no one's completely sure where their own allegiances lie, much less anyone else. The second half tends to be more aggressive and up-front with Cylons trying to sew discord as they reveal and burn down the ship while the remaining humans race towards the victory and hope they don't run out of resources along the way.
>
> It's actually a really fun game, especially with the right group. Having watched the show is a plus, since it'll make the various references make more sense (such as why certain unique character abilities are what they are for that character), but it's still a solid game in its own right and having watched the show is not at all required to enjoy the game.

1: What's the best head to head games on here?

> 3: I would say *Twilight Struggle*, *Carcassonne*, **Castles of Burgundy**, *Race for the Galaxy* are definitely worth it for head to head games. There are a few on the list I haven't played so I can't really speak for those.

## Great Games with Traditional Playing Cards

...

So where should you start? Hopefully some of the descriptions I have provided will intrigue you enough to give a particular game a shot, or look into it further. But often games will depend on who you are playing with, the number of players you have, and the kind of game you are looking for. So to help you branch out beyond the repertoire that you might already be familiar with, here are some recommendations for games that I especially suggest for different situations.

***Are you looking for...***

\- **a game for just two players?** [GOPS](http://www.pagat.com/misc/gops.html) and [Scopa](http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html) are two simpler games that are quite rewarding. If you want a trick-taking game for just two, then [Briscola](http://www.pagat.com/aceten/briscola.html) and [German Whist](https://www.pagat.com/whist/german_whist.html) are both straight forward and good choices, while [Le Truc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truc) is fantastic for those who like bluffing, and [Schnapsen](http://www.pagat.com/marriage/schnaps.html) is worth the effort to learn if you enjoy skilful play. [**Cribbage**](http://www.pagat.com/adders/crib6.html) and [Gin Rummy](http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html) are two non trick-taking classics that are every bit as good today as they have always been.

\- **a game for four-players in partnerships?** There are several good trick-taking games to choose from in this category, and while the ever-popular [Bridge](http://www.pagat.com/boston/bridge.html) is good, the learning curve can be steep. I recommend starting with a simpler game like [Euchre](http://www.pagat.com/euchre/euchre.html) or [Whist](http://www.pagat.com/whist/whist.html), or else something that involves more skill, like [500](http://www.pagat.com/euchre/500.html), [Rook](http://www.pagat.com/kt5/rook.html), or [Spades](http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html), which incorporate the fun of bidding and give opportunity for a winning bidder to strengthen their hand.

\- **a trick-taking game for an odd number of players?** [Ninety-Nine](http://www.pagat.com/exact/99.html) is the best trick-taker that plays with exactly three players. [Hearts](http://www.pagat.com/reverse/hearts.html) and [Oh Hell](http://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html) can both handle various player counts, and are very good; if you enjoy bidding for how many tricks you think you will win then Oh Hell is an absolute must.

\- **a light social game for a larger group?** Try the classic climbing game [President](http://www.pagat.com/climbing/president.html), the almost brainless [Ranter-Go-Round](http://www.pagat.com/cuckoo/cuckoo.html), or the frenzy of [Spoons](http://www.pagat.com/eights/spoons.html), all of which are easy to learn and don not require too much brain power. [Blitz](http://www.pagat.com/draw/scat.html)and [Cheat](http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html) are also good choices for fun social games that can work with more than four players.

\- **a game that is fast-paced?** Try the craziness of two player [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html)/Spit, or else ramp up the difficulty slightly with the frantic game-play of the popular [Nertz](http://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html), both of which have simultaneous real-time game-play. [Egyptian Ratscrew](http://www.pagat.com/war/egyptrat.html) also requires quick reactions and speed.

> [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html) (2-4 players) - Also called "Spit", this a high speed game similar in style to [Nertz](http://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html), but slightly easier and more suitable for children. The aim is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by simultaneously and quickly playing cards of higher or lower value to a common stock.

\- **a game that is unusual and out-of-the-ordinary?** Try the logical deduction required by the clever and inventive [Eleusis](http://www.pagat.com/eights/eleusis.html), or the long and savoury gameplay of [Zetema](https://www.pagat.com/invented/zetema.html).

\- **a game for older children?** Most of the games in the "Social and Family Games" category will work, but fun games that I have had good success with in playing with children include [Cheat](http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html), [Fan Tan](http://www.pagat.com/domino/sevens.html), [Knock Out Whist](http://www.pagat.com/whist/kowhist.html) (which also serves as a good introduction to trick-taking), [Palace](http://www.pagat.com/beating/shithead.html), [Speed](http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html), and [Spoons](http://www.pagat.com/eights/spoons.html). If they can handle the scoring system, [Scopa](http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html) is definitely a rewarding game that older children can enjoy. [GOPS](http://www.pagat.com/misc/gops.html) produces an excellent head-to-head battle-of-wits for just two.

\- **a game for younger children?** There's a number of classic and very simple games not included on this list, such as [Beggar My Neighbour](https://www.pagat.com/war/beggar_my_neighbour.html) (2-3 players), [Crazy Eights](http://www.pagat.com/eights/crazy8s.html) (2-7 players), [Go Fish](http://www.pagat.com/quartet/gofish.html) (2-6 players), [Old Maid](http://www.pagat.com/passing/oldmaid.html) (2-12 players), [Slap Jack](http://www.pagat.com/war/slapjack.html) (2-8 players), [Snap](https://www.pagat.com/war/snap.html) (2-4 players), and [War](http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html) (2 players). Be aware that some games like Beggar My Neighbour and also War involve no decisions and are a matter of pure luck!

So dust off that deck of playing cards that is looking down expectantly at you from the shelf, invite over some family or friends, and get those playing cards to the table. Enjoy your deck and discover the fun that traditional card games have been bringing people around the world for centuries!

77: This was an absolutely amazing post! Thanks so much for taking the time to do this. It's great to have not only a list of great card games, but a description and a link to learn how to play. Fantastic!

37: Great post!

I also like the card game Golf a lot.

> 10: Seconding golf, especially the 6 card version of it. Good for workplaces, usually even non-gamer people learn it fast and enjoy it. With 6 or more players, we play it with double decks.

23: Egyptian Ratscrew has always been my favorite. The look on people’s faces when you randomly slap into a game of people you don’t know is the best.

14: As a Wisconsinite, I was very happy to see sheepshead on the list. Sheepshead or bust!

10: One game that is obviously missing from the list (as it is very obscure) is Tscbhinquina, a trick-taking game for *five* people and my personal favourite among trick-taking games. It is played 2v3 where the groups themselves are partially hidden information (in the bidding round, a player may call out a card to partner up with whoever holds it). I've written up the rules [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwpauc8QjAKoZ3RaeHFUYzFtQ0k/view?usp=drivesdk), as the only ruleset I could find online was in Romansh.

Also, a shoutout to Tichu, which can *almost* be played with a traditional deck of cards (you need four extra cards, e.g. modified jokers), and is a fantastic shedding game.

10: I also have to mention [Kemps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemps_(card_game)?wprov=sfla1) (also known as Signal, and a million other names). It's a dead-simple real-time game for teams of 2. You can go up to 12 players with a regular deck, though it does get more chaotic as the player count increases.

Goal is to get 4 of a kind by swapping cards in your 4 card hand with the 4 cards face up on the table. There are no turns, just a free for all as cards are revealed. If no one wants to make any more swaps, the face-up cards are trashed and a new 4 are revealed.

The *trick* is that once you get 4 of a kind, your *partner* must shout "Kemps" to claim victory. You can signal them in any way, as long as other players are able to observe it (i.e. no under the table, texting, etc), but it should be secretive because if another player suspects you they can call "Counter-kemps" to eliminate you. Game continues until all but one team has won or been eliminated, and points are awarded for place

Again it's super straightforward, but has a lot of silly emergent gameplay. There is obviously a speed element, but I don't find that slower players are terribly disadvantaged because defense is just as important as offense. In fact 100% defense is even viable, and creates hilarious tension at the table as you just stare everyone down looking for meaningful facial gestures.

5: I have a ton of unique card decks but I never use them anymore because I don’t like the few games that I know. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Crazy 8s, speed, and rummy get old pretty fast. Can’t wait to read these and find the perfect 2 player game.

> 2: It's a perfect way to use custom decks! For two players, I especially love playing German Whist, Scopa, Le Truc, and **Cribbage**.

4: Great resource, thanks!

Happily bookmarked and up voted.

I was also glad to see that **Nertz** made this list. It's one of our favorites.

4: Spades is all you need 👍

## What are your favorite 2 person games? Preferably card games

62: **Cribbage**. If you want to make it a more skill-based game, less luck-based, deal from the same deck for each hand until you run out of cards.

That is, deal and play the first hand, set those cards aside, deal and play the second hand from the remaining 39 card, set the cards from that hand aside, deal the third hand from the remaining 26 cards, set the cards from that hand aside, deal the last 13 cards. By the time you get to those last 13 cards you should know exactly what your opponent has in her hand. Then start over, with the player who went second going first now.

> 15: We play a lot of **cribbage**. Might have to look into playing it your way, but then I have to pay attention 😋
>
> 7: Definitely Cribbage. I bought a cheap board for $4 and we've played hundreds of games with it. It's fun and perfect for two people to play.

25: Not a card game but check out patchwork. It's one of the more popular 2 player games and easy to get into but still has interesting choices.

Another really fun and popular 2 player game is jaipur, which is a card game.

Codenames duet is the cooperative 2 player version of codenames.

If you have some experience with boardgames or want something more challenging, check out 7 Wonders duel.

Other suggestions: port royal, Forbidden island (cooperative but not a card game), *star realms*, and lost cities the card game.

If you want more in depth suggestions, there is a wiki and daily recommendations thread in [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/). To find out more about a specific game, check boardgamegeek and maybe watch some videos. The dice Tower usually has a good overview of the rules and game play.

26: Gin Rummy My wife and I lived without internet for a year.

> 8: This is how we passed the time while she was in labor. Still kicked my ass.

> 7: I keep a deck of cards and a notebook in my purse. If the SO and I are out at the bar, we play, and I date our scores. It's fun to look back and see who won what game when and where.

21: I play go. It has a following in China, Korea, and Japan similar to what chess has here. The game is called baduk in Korea, the subreddit is [r/baduk](https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/).

Also chess for that matter. ;-D

Both games are pretty widely played, especially in college towns. Not cards, but among the most popular board games in history.

13: Skipbo!

12: Backgammon! Oh man, it's a lot of fun.

Simple to learn, not so simple to master...plus the randomness of dice!

12: Nerts. It's like multiplayer solitaire. Each person needs their own deck.

11: 13! We always played for money. $.25/card and $2/chop.

It's real name is [Tien Len](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiến_lên), but most English-speaking people call it 13. There are all kinds of variations - most importantly, the three of spades rule.

If you go out on the three of spades as a standalone single, you win bonus money.

If interested, pm and I'll walk you thru it. It's a little much for beginners, unless you really play a lot of card games.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiến_lên

12: I’ve found Fluxx to be pretty fun.

10: Mille Bournes is a really fun card game based on auto racing. You don’t have to care about cars to enjoy it, it’s just a theme. It works for 2 - 6 players and it can be quick if you want it to be, or long if you choose to keep score several hands. Actually some of the scoring and strategy makes more sense in a multihand game.

7: Speed

8: Not a card game but Yahtzee is pretty cheap, takes up little space and is fun with just two players. Every once in a great while my husband and I get in the habit of playing it but usually we play Rummikub[Rummikub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummikub) together. I'm not sure if you want to spend more than a couple bucks on something that takes up space, however. Sorry that neither of my suggestions are card games.

7: Not a card game, but we love to play *Carcassonne*. We got it cheap on Amazon and it + any expansions fit in one smallish box. I think it has a lot of replay value, and I actually think I like it better as 2 player because you get more tiles.

I also love to play poker - more than 2 players is nice, but I've played countless hours with just one other person. There is also chess, checkers , etc. In fact, a lot of places sell a 15 or 20 in one set with a decent variety of classic board games in one box.

## Best dice games

What's your favorite dice games? I've really like dice drafting games. I've played pioneer days, dice throne, tada (with the kids) and have roll player coming in. What are some other dice games you guys enjoy that I might be missing out on?

14: 

- *Grand Austria Hotel* 
- *Roll for the Galaxy*
- One Deck Dungeon / Forest of Shadows

10: I still enjoy King of Tokyo, which is just Yahtzee with giant monsters.

10:

- *Grand Austria Hote*l (dice drafting)
- Lorenzo il Magnifico (dice rolling; dice determines worker strength)
- Troyes (dice drafting)
- **The Castles of Burgundy** (dice worker placement)
- The Voyages of Marco Polo (dice worker placement)
- Star Wars: Rebellion (dice rolling; wargame)

> Worker placement is a form of action drafting, by taking an action with a worker you should be diminishing the range of options for your opponents.
>
> Therefore, Roll for the Galaxy is not a worker placement game. Nations also has workers, that you put places, but it is isn't a worker placement game either. Just because it has workers doesn't make it worker placement.

9: Dice Forge is fantastic - it's like deck building but with dice. You can upgrade your dice and such. I'm really looking forward to the expansion.

6: Roll Player for me.

7: Dicemasters is a great dice drafting game. I think it's biggest knock with a lot of people is the collectible aspect of it, but with the game's newest shift in direction toward a "living" dice game I am hoping it will pop up on more people's radar.

8: I am surprised to not see Dice Throne mentioned yet. Its a fantastic dice chucker that plays out like an arcade fighting game. Plus really quick and is easy to learn.

6: Hm, my group doesn't play a lot of dice games...

King of Tokyo - Probably my favourite. It's not a perfect game, but it's pretty decent.

Champions of Midgard - One of those things where I can accept it might be a good game, but I don't like it. I'm not a huge fan of worker placement games to begin with, and unbalanced character powers always irks me. This one honestly only uses dice for combat so I'm not sure how much it counts.

Tiny Epic Galaxies - Decision paralysis: the game. I can totally believe that there are groups that enjoy figuring out the optimal move that everyone else can make with each face of each of your dice, but it was not the group I played with.

So yeah, I think I'll keep an eye on this thread too. I don't dislike dice as a mechanic, but none of the games I've played with dice have been total hits.

6: Too Many Bones blows every other dice-drafting/dice-building game I have away. It's very much on the premium side of things, financially speaking, but it is worth every penny and then some!

5: Tiny Epic Galaxies with the Beyond the Black expansion. The expansion enhances an already neat little game.

5: My favourite lately is Sagarada, which has lots of coloured dice. As well as Las Vegas, which a great area majority dice game!

5: *Roll for the Galaxy*, Roll Player and Quantum are all excellent games.

4: Age of War awesome little dice drafting game
One Deck Dungeon small box 1-2 player dungeon crawl, tons of beautiful translucent colored dice

17: 

1. *Roll for the Galaxy*: Such a beautiful, well-put together adaptation of Race for the Galaxy to a different format. One great expansion already and another one on the way.
2. Dice City: This game killed both Machi Koro and Kingsburg for me by combining the customization of the former with the structure of the latter, and being easier to teach and learn than both. Such a wonderful game.
3. Blueprints: Not a dice game in the traditional sense, but this architecture game uses the dice it has in such an inventive and creative way. Excellent little filler game.
4. King of Tokyo: Yahtzee with Kaiju, you can't beat it. This game is single-handedly responsible for getting an entire family of friends into board games through their children.
5. Dice Town: Just a fun, dice-chucking Western game.

I suppose, on reflection, I really don't have many dice games at all. In fact, these five, even with a couple of loose definitions, are pretty much the only games I have where dice feature prominently, with a couple of exceptions in other genres like Champions of Midgard and **Castles of Burgundy**. I'm looking forward to see what other dice games people bring up.

13: 

In rough order:

- The Voyages of Marco Polo
- Lorenzo Il Magnifico
- Santa Maria
- Pulsar 2849
- *Grand Austria Hotel*
- Rajas of the Ganges

OK, that's 6 :)

> 6: This guy euros. If you haven't, also check out La Granja.

11: Tried limiting this list to the games where rolling and using dice is very prevalent in the way you play:

1. Sagrada
2. Seasons
3. Masmorra
4. Dice Throne

9: I'm surprised Dice Forge hasn't landed on a single list here! Dice Forge is really an awesome game. While it may not have a huge amount of *depth* it does have a very *wide* pool of strategy. I've seen players win just by powering up the dice themselves and forgoing most card purchases/plays, and i've seen folks win through highly strategic card purchases, and a combination of both.

It also has awesome production value. This game feels like the production value is over 50 or 60$ maybe, but [is often for sale under 40$](https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-DIF01-Dice-Forge/dp/B06XVW4N17/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527264849&sr=8-2&keywords=dice+forge&dpID=517Gdh%2ByWBL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch). The art is great, especially enjoyable if you like similar art styles, like the stuff that comes out of Iello. It's super, super easy to teach to newbies, even those that don't play games as a hobby and the replayability is sky high. Player engagement is also high, as all players roll on everyone's turn they remain engaged, and there's only a very small handful of "take that" mechanics at play. When those mechanics do emerge, i've never seen anyone get annoyed about it. The game has fast gameplay and it ends pretty quickly so it doesn't take too much time to get a game in, and scales from 2-4 players perfectly. I think Dice Forge goes underappreciated because lots of gamers see it as a shallow game because of its simple mechanics. If anyone is looking for an exciting dice game about out scoring opponents, Dice Forge is definitely worth checking out. Also, physically building a dice is super cool :)

1. Troyes
2. Quantum
3. Dice Forge
4. **Castles of Burgundy**
5. Galaxy Trucker

> 7: I'm shocked that no one else mentioned Quantum.

> 3: Crazy I had to go this far down to find Troyes - one of my favorites.

8: Zombie Dice - so quick and simple, and we have fun playing it with groups of all ages and sizes (but more than 8 players is a little much)
Champions of Midgard - love the dice warrior recruitment and battle mechanics.
Sagrada - really like to simple sudoku style puzzle you create from a pool of rolled dice!

So far, these are the only 3 dice games that I play regularly, and my partner and I love them!

I'll be watching this thread for more dice game ideas!
We've been eyeing Dice Forge at half price books and were going to get it this weekend during their 20%-off sale. Does anyone here recommend it?

7: The idea of what a dice game is will change from person to person. For me, I will consider games that use dice as the main gameplay element. As a result, the games I consider dice games are often simpler and shorter than most other games I play. For example, I would not consider **The Castles of Burgundy**. There are dice in the game, but the dice are a tool to set collection and tile-drafting mainly. **Also, the fact that The Castles of Burgundy: The Dice Game exists hints me that the original might not be considered a dice game.** Then again, it's a personal choice and I realize that some people will consider it.

Qwixx - This one is just great. So simple, so fun, so replayable. I love how the game incentivize players to push their luck. You want to mark the most spots, but by going faster maybe you will be able to block your opponents before they can mark more than you.

Can't Stop - Speaking of pushing your luck, this one is a classic for a reason. The simple idea of rolling four dice and placing them by pairs is what makes this game work. It's a probability marvel.

King of Tokyo - This is another one that's popular for a reason. It's so fun to just barge in Tokyo and start attacking everyone so hard that they are too preoccupied by their wounds to attack you. I love the card synergies that let's you personalize your monster too. I wasn't too keen on King of New York. The game wasn't as streamlined and it made the game just a bit more complex, when what I loved about the first one was its casual appeal.

Pickomino - Not a great game by itself, but I consider it for the appeal it had on my extended family. It's simple and quick enough for everyone to enjoy it and the push-your-luck aspect can give it an exciting aspect. I think I might prefer so other Knizia dice game designs, but this is the one I had most success with I think. The box says 2-7 players, it shouldn't be played by more than 5 in my opinion, the game really drags with too many players.

Dungeon Roll - This one is a great solo experience. When I worked at a board game pub, I would often end my shift with a few rounds of this with a pint to cool off. It sounds stupid and uninteresting at first, but you always look forward to your next party, to your next treasure, to the next dungeon floor, etc. This game constantly makes you long for what's coming and that makes it addictive in a weird sort of way.

Honorable mentions go to the following: Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age, Strike!, POW!, **Bang! The Dice Game** and Star Trek: Five-Year Mission. I like each of these to some degree, but they wouldn't make the cut for a reason or another.

7: 

1. Voyages of Marco Polo
2. John Company
3. **Castles of Burgundy**
4. *Roll for the Galaxy*
5. *Grand Austria Hotel*

8:

- Lords of Vegas
- Lords of Vegas
- Lords of Vegas
- Lords of Vegas
- Lords of Vegas

LoV is an outstanding match of theme and mechanics.

Other dice games I've played are King of New York and **Castles of Burgundy** but I didn't like them.

5: 

Tough choice. I love games that use dice cleverly. To call it a dice game, dice would have to play a central role, IMO.

- *Roll for the Galaxy* Aside from being a deep tableau building game that plays remarkably fast, I just love rolling a cupful of those magnificient tiny dice.
- **Castles of Burgundy** Point Salad at its best. Though much depends on what you roll, there are so many ways to mitigate and plan for 'bad' rolls. I'm generally a fan of dice used as input luck. Also, it's great for 2p. It ain't pretty, but I don't think it's as bad people make it out to be.
- *Grand Austria Hotel* A favorite of my wife's. Usually, every round presents tough choices on how to accomplish your plans with the available dice.
- Claustrophobia Roll some dice and use them to either activate your unfortunate band of condemned adventureres or your infornal powers. Roll dice again when attacking. The mix of input luck and output luck makes for a tactical game with tense moments. Its wildly asymmetrical and huge amounts of fun for 2p.
- Sagrada Its often good, but rarily great. Still, it has quickly become one of my most played games. Works with just about anyone.

There are a lot of runner ups: Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Galaxy, Liar's Dice, King of Tokyo, Bang: The Dice Game and CV to name a few.

7: 

1. Quarriors
2. *Roll for the Galaxy*
3. Dice Forge
4. Pandemic: The Cure
5. One Deck Dungeon

5:

1. **Castles of Burgundy** The greatest ugly game
2. *Grand Austria Hotel* Fun at any player count as long as people don't have AP
3. King of Tokyo Holds a nostalgic place in my mind and I enjoy more than it probably deserves.
4. Roll Player

Admittedly I haven't played a ton of dice chuckers, so the list is only four. I expect Troyes will be added in, hopefully soon.

What are some good dice games? I know Yahtzee, Meyer, Chicago, Shut the box, liar's dice.

Also I wish I could post a collection pic here but most of my dice disappeared when I moved =(

Edit: with "standard" d6 dice or DnD dice or others would be fine.

4: Are you looking for games where you just use dice and nothing else or board games with dice?

King of Tokyo and Dice Throne make good use of the Yahtzee style play but with unique dice and mechanics.

> 3: Mostly something with dice and or cards that's easily portable. I'll look into those, thanks!

3: My favorite is [10,000](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000). I've actually never played with the rule where you can pick up from someone else's score if they leave dice, because it seems broken. We also don't enforce a minimum score to keep points. It's easy to make house rules.

My family loves playing it though. It's great with a large group, or 1 on 1. My mom last night beat me by 4,000 points, because it took me literally half the game to even get on the board. It was insane.

3: There's a game that was invented for conventions called "Button Men" that I think would be right up your alley, exactly what you're looking for. You can find some of the pieces online for cheap, or even print and play. There's an app on iOS, or at least there was a few years ago. Very portable, cheap/free, and just a polyhedral set of dice needed.

There's also casual, portable games like "Ninja Roll", and "Dungeon Roll", made in the last few years. Self-contained, fast, easy. They're both fun and fine.

A more complex, specialized dice game that I like is called "Dragon Dice". Not for everyone, but I love it, even though it's hard to find people to play with. It's collectible, so not everyone likes that.

My favorite dice game of all time is called "Dungeon Dice", it's been sold via Kickstarter the last few years, made by Pot Luck games. Soon it will be released to stores, or you can get it on their website. Phenomenally designed game, and a complete blast. Medium-hardness to teach, but fun to play, even for people who aren't usually gamers. The game is self-contained (not collectible). It is a bit expensive, but I love it so much I'm fine with that.

There's also stuff like Star Wars Destiny (collectible) and Quarriors (self-contained), and Marvel Dice Masters (collectible). All good games.

Oh, there's also stuff like Bang! The Dice Game. I think a Lord of the Rings dice game exists too, but I think it's out of print, I never played it.

3: How is Farkle not up there

> 1: 10000 and Farkle are pretty much the same thing

## Best deck building card games

What are your top 5 deck building games? Deck/pool building

18: ITT: People confusing <u>deck-building</u> with hand management.

Concordia, Century: Spice Road, Food Chain Magnate and the like are hand management games because you have access to all of the cards you have acquired at the same time. Even Rococo is stretching the definition a bit.

As for my choices:

1. *Arctic Scavengers +HQ +Recon*
2. Valley of the Kings
3. *Star Realms*
4. *Clank*
5. Dale of Merchants

> > 3: I think it depends on what you are looking for. If you are after optimizations and engine building, Arctic won't offer you as much as some of the other options. Its strength is the multi-use cards and the bluffing elements.

13: DEEP BREATH...

*Star Realms* is a fantastic two player deck builder with evocative sci fi art to go with the galactic war theme. No points in this one, just blow up your enemy.

Eminent Domain shares the space theme with Star Realms but this one is about building an empire by conquering/colonizing planets. It features a "follow the leader" mechanism so if you watch what the other players are doing you can get more than one thing done in a round.

*Aeon's End* is a post-apocalyptic fantasy cooperative game where you are fighting a horrifying monster that is sort of running on a script (their deck is kind of like an AI routine that gets randomized each game).

Paperback is a word game where the letters you may use are the cards you've added to your deck. Buy a letter that is hard to use and it will have a better ability.

*Arctic Scavengers* is a frozen wasteland apocalypse game where you must build the most populist colony by getting the best mercs and fighting the other players over rare items found in the wastes or just digging through trash and trying to find something valuable.

All of the games I've mentioned are fantastic games. If the theme sounds good, I'd say it's a winner.

11: Valley of the Kings

[/u/r2d8](https://www.reddit.com/u/r2d8/) getinfo

It has a couple standalone expansions. They are all about the same but most people that have played them all say Afterlife has their favorite cards. I find it to be much more accessible than **Dominion** or Ascension thanks to limited market where the players can buy cards from. Also the pyramid mechanic of falling cards is a bit silly but it works and it does support the theme more than you'd expect.

8: *Aeon's End*

[/u/r2d8](https://www.reddit.com/u/r2d8/) getinfo

> 5: Yep. *Aeon's End* is currently at the top of the list for my wife and I. Played a game a night almost since we got it. So good.
>
> > 3: How well does it play to new deckbuilders?
> >
> > > 4: It's not the simplest deckbuilder, but it has an awesome tutorial. All your first game is 100% set up in the box when you open it. There is a special separate sheet and pre-sorted decks that it walks you through set up and such to make your first game easy to learn without having to worry about setting up the market or Nemesis or anything else.
> > >
> > > If they're experienced with board games in general, it'll be no problem at all. But it might be intimidating for newbies to the hobby with no one to walk them through it and explain certain things.

6: I've not delved too deep into the genre but I've enjoyed the time I've spent with marvel legendary quite a bit.

If you're open to bag building as well as deck building then maybe look at automobiles. It's a nifty design that i think adds a lot to the mechanic.

> 5: I must second this. Legendary: Marvel is fantastic if they have an interest in the Marvel Universe.
>
> *Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle* is VERY friendly to beginners, and the theme is a big selling point to a lot of people.
>
> *Star Realms* is great if you want to get them a second deck building game for about $13. Also check out the rating on it [/u/r2d8](https://www.reddit.com/u/r2d8/) *getinfo Star Realms*

5: I posted some of my favorites on someone else asking for a good coop version. Since I prefer coop deck building anyway, it was an easy response. I'll copy my response from the other post:

I have been told that *Aeon's End* is supposed to be very good though. There are several cooperative deckbuilders I have played that I can recommend:

- *Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle* - This one took me a bit by surprise. It plays over 7 games (the years of the books) and adds mechanics, difficulty, and/or cards with each one. It's a game that seems very simple on the surface but really piles on some complexity and can end up being very compelling once you get into it. One downside as there's no "common" card that can be purchased if the row doesn't have good cards.
- DC Deck Building Game + Crisis Expansions - This one may be a hard sell for you as DC Deckbuilding does not come with cooperative gameplay out of the box. You have to get at least one of the Crisis expansions to make it cooperative, but it's an interesting challenge once you put it together. It's not as highly recommended due to the theme being more window dressing than really part of the gameplay, but the mechanics are fairly solid.
- Attack on Titan: Deck Building Game - This one is from Cryptozoic who made the DC Deck Building Game. It has nearly the same mechanics, but was made for Co-Op and is strongly tied to its theme. It adds a physical play component, where you have to move your character to one of the card locations to buy that card, if you can't move to it, you can't get it. Your goal is to defeat Titans who will try to break down your 5 wall tokens. Defeating Titans takes resources that you would also use to buy cards, so you have to balance your physical location, defeating Titans, as well as buying your cards.
- Legendary Encounters - There's several versions of this one (Alien, Predator, and Firefly). Each is strongly tied to its theme and has 2 types of rows to deal with. One is for buying cards to put in your deck, the other is for obstacles that stand in your way and must be defeated. The obstacles can be villains to defeat or events that cause something to happen, really helping the theme. There is a Marvel version of this game, but I find its theme isn't as strong and the game not as cohesive.

> 2: I second the Harry Potter game. It's great as a gateway game, too. I don't know how much experience your friend has with designer board games.

3: Greatly enjoying Tyrants of the Underdark. Beyond deckbuilding there's a board with various locations you fight over. The deck will decide how you fight. Also the deck you buy from can be customized. You shuffle together 2 half decks of different themes. Worth a look to combine deck building and light strategy.

4: *Arctic Scavengers* hands down.

[/u/r2d8](https://www.reddit.com/u/r2d8/) getinfo

4: Hero Realms is a fantastic choice. It's a new release that functions like *Star Realms* but uses a fantasy setting and adds custom classes with abilities. It's ridiculously good.

3: Trains is great. Like **dominion** with route building

Best deckbuilding game? Thinking about getting into a deck builder, what's everyone's favorite? I've had some experience with Ascension and Smash Up (sort of similar), but there's just so many out there...

Pros and cons would be wonderful.

13: **Dominion** is the best one.

> 4: I'll third. **Dominion** (base game) + Seaside + Prosperity has a huge amount of variety and replayability. Addition expansions add even more. Adventures, Empires and perhaps Intrigue seem to be the most popular ones after Seaside/Prosperity.

> 3: I second this, **Dominion** is like the Original so it's a good starting point. Other deck builders tend to build off of dominion and either add their own twist or improve on **dominion**'s mechanics. If you're looking to get into deckbuilders...you really can't go wrong with **Dominion**.

12: **Dominion** is best with a few caveats.

It's dry and themeless. It's good if you like a very pure, mathematical experience.
It's expensive. **Dominion** can be good, but the base game alone does not have much variety, and you will want expansions quickly. This makes for a high cost of ownership.
**Dominion** is best with only 2 players. Many serious players strongly dislike it with more.

On the opposite end, you have Ascension Apprentice Edition which is a super cheap, 2 player only version of Ascension. This is more thematic, and uses the random market style. If you're really unsure, this is the cheapest option.

*Star Realms* and Hero Realms are the cheapest deckbuilding games out there (except Apprentice Edition). They're almost identical, aside from theme. Hero Realms is also 2-4p. These are solid, excellent games and very popular. Unlike most deckbuilding games, these are directly confrontational. You win by killing your opponent instead of just earning victory points.

*Star Realms* has a FREE app. Start there.

Valley of the Kings is a more advanced game. Play something else first and get a handle on deckbuilding. This is a game of limited time and very hard choices. You can do multiple things with each card... It's choosing which function to use, and mostly WHEN.

*Arctic Scavengers* is an interesting twist on things. Cards can have multiple uses, you mix a static market with a special draw pile where an action let's you Draw X, Keep 1.

Turns are on your own, but the end of the round has you fighting over a high powered card... Using any cards left in your hand. So every card, you can pick Action A, Action B (sometimes C and D), or NOT playing them to help earn the bonus card. There's bluffing too, because maybe the cards you kept are worthless in the fight, but it makes someone hold back more cards trying to beat you.

Quarriors is like deckbuilding but with dice. You buy new, stronger dice into your bag and roll them to get creatures that attack other creatures. If yours live until your next turn, they earn you victory points. It's fairly simplistic, but the dice aspect adds another random level to it.

There are a lot more deckbuilders out there, but these are common and popular, while also not being too similar to others. Like DC Comics Deckbuilding is a lot like Ascension, Cthulhu Realms is based on *Star Realms*, etc.

> 4: I love **Dominion**, first and foremost. I think the "balancing" mechanic of victory points being bad and useless cards is smart. I love the emphasis on trashing. I love Cursing my opponents' decks into a bloated mess. I think most importantly the (initial) limit of 1 action 1 buy per turn makes for fun choices and interesting hand-management cardplay that almost every other deckbuilder doesn't bother with. I even love the theme, actually - have defended it vigorously and will again. It's abstract but it's there and often pretty clever.
>
> I just played Valley of the Kings for the first time last week. It *became* very interesting, but it can be hard at the outset to really tell what the game/puzzle actually *is* (I mean, entomb the most and best stuff obviously, but it's hard to tell when to start entombing on your first play), so neither of us really had a strong sense of purpose or strategy until toward the end. But I think it's got real potential, and it's sure cheap. Also as far as theme goes it makes **Dominion** look like Conan or something, just nothing there at all but the mechanics (which is fine!).
>
> Star Realms is pretty fun to pass the time. Even the physical version is really cheap, but the app is notably FREE and saves you from having to use the really horrible scoring cards that come with the deck. The game itself is pretty similar to Ascension: There's a central market row, you draw a 5 card hand and you get to play all of them, with each card giving you money to buy more cards, letting you draw or force discards or mess with the trade row, or just giving you points. The points are framed as damage you're doing to your opponent but it's the same thing, just a twist to make you *feel* like you're interacting with your opponent. There's more interaction happening in the market row, but you're going to be limited to a few choices based on money usually, and then you'll just go with the one that fits faction-wise so you can get those sweet perks. That's why I don't really like the deckbuilders with the limited market row - it throws a lot of long-term strategy out the window and makes your choices much much simpler, to the detriment of my enjoyment. I don't think strategy in Star Realms (Cthulhu Realms, whatever) goes much deeper than: 1. Pick one or two factions and focus on them, 2. As in all deckbuilders, trashing is good if you can get it, 3. Outposts are priority targets at the beginning unless you can get a full Blob rush going.
>
> I really really like *Arctic Scavengers*, and the expansion modules really turn it into something fun and interesting and *different*. I think the skirmishes are actually a much more interesting way to inject some interaction beyond just buying out the last X card that you knew your opponent wanted. There will never be as much variation game-to-game as **Dominion**, but the cards available from the base game and expansions provide you with a pretty deep and pretty well-balanced puzzle with multiple paths to victory, and lots of very specific counterplay that might not work with a larger cardpool. Probably my favorite theming on a deckbuilder as well.
>
> I'll just throw out on the side that Friday is a fun puzzle and perhaps just the *tightest* deckbuilder, although it's only for 1 player. It'll make you better at this kind of game, I think, just because doing well at it requires you to really understand the concept of a pared-down, efficient deck.

9: **Dominion** is my favorite, but we've been playing a lot of Paperback lately since my husband is a big fan of word games.

5: I just don't love pure deck building games but I do like the mechanic when it is well integrated into a board game as one of a number of mechanics.

With that in mind I would suggest both Great Western Trail and Mombasa with a nod to Rococo as well. All great games that feature deck/hand building but incorporate many other interesting mechanics and elements with a bigger game wrapped around them.

> 1: You should play *Clank*!
>
> > 1: THIS!

5: Core Worlds is the best deck building game in my collection. **Dominion** may have started it all but it's kind of dull by comparison.

Pros of Core Worlds:

- More thematic and (especially with the expansions)
- Far more depth of strategy and tactical play
- Unlike games like Ascension or *Star Realms*, there is a progression of cards introduced into the game so you don't have uber-power cards sitting undrafted all game or until the first player gets a "lucky" draw
- Variable setup and factions with different starting cards increases the replayability
- You only see ~1/3 to 1/2 of the cards each game so no two games will play the same
- They address the start player advantage (and in different ways depending on the number of players)

Neutral:

- Random card draw means that you might be going for one type of deck early on but then never see certain cards that help your early strategy. Part of the gameplay is planning around this eventuality.
- Lots of table space is required, especially with the expansions.
- Player interaction is limited to acquiring cards from the centre before your opponents can. Sometimes there will be heavy competition for cards, other times players may be going down different strategic paths and drafting will not be as competitive.

Cons:

- More depth means a longer game. Playing four players with expansions usually takes over an hour, maybe close to two hours. However, this is a meaty game and not filler. Base game can be pushed through in an hour or so.
- Complex rules and, unlike **Dominion**, most cards stay in play and add rules and event triggers as the game goes on. Expansions add even more rules and event triggers as well as increase the options available from the start.

4: My son loves to play *Star Realms*. cheap, simple and he can teach his friends and others to play quickly.

> 2: Came to give +1 to *Star Realms* aswell. It wipes the floor with **Dominion** in my opinion.

3: My personal favourite is *Aeon's End* at the moment. I also love the Ascension series (Dreamscape and Rise of Vigil being my favourites). Attack on Titan is also pretty good, but really, really difficult to win. I don't much care for **Dominion**, and I despise Marvel Legendary (Legendary Encounters: Alien is alright, but I sold my copy).

3: Totally *Aeon's End*. It gives deck building a purpose. It's the best deck builder I've ever played. Exciting, thematic, easy to learn, but lots of replayability.

3: *Arctic Scavengers*. Tight, combative, incorporates bluffing, constant knifefight.

3: So, deckbuilding mechanics are my 2nd boardgame love (behind drafting and ahead of stock trading) but you have to separate these games into: pure and mechanical varities. The best pure deckbuilder is **Dominion** bitnit can be VERY dry. *Star Realms* is amazing and more interactive, but can get really brutal.

Tyrants of the Underdark may be my favorite use of the mechanic of deck building. It's a mix of risk and **dominion** and it's so clever you wonder why it took WOTC to come up with it.

There are some near misses with the genre too. *Arctic Scavengers* and Draconis try to add something to the mechanic, but neither capture the true beating heart of deckbuilding

3: *Arctic Scavengers* with the Recon expansion is a favorite. Easy to learn, short playtime, but lots of good strategy and variety to it.
