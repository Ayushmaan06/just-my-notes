**MyMan**

MyMan isn't the only Pac-Man clone for the Linux terminal, but it's the one the author of the [article](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/linux-toy-myman) chose to include because:

1. The visual style is appealing, it rings true to the original.
2. It's conveniently packaged for author's Linux distribution (Fedora) so it was an easy install. But you should check out your other options as well.

Installation is simple for Fedora:

```bash
dnf install myman
```

> [The Greatest Game You Will Ever Play](http://www.thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/).

Tales of Maj'Eyal 

> It remains my favorite Roguelike. I'm not sure how open source it still is now that it has DLC, but the base game is still in repo where I first found it.

[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/). This depends greatly on whether you like roguelikes or not (see [r/roguelikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/) for people who do). These are games that are typically turn-based, often played on a text terminal, played on a square grid, with some character cruising through a dungeon, finding items and powering up and learning that a "Red Potion" in this life is a potion of healing. DCSS is probably the best-balanced of these, and has some helpful automation to eliminate grinding.

>  A Rogue game where you have to descend 18 floors down a dungeon to retrieve the orb of Zot, and then escape with it. Many classes and races to choose from. Very active development. You can play it right now right from your browser, but local builds are also available. Also worth to mention is the [wiki](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crawl_Wiki).

[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://cataclysmdda.org/). Unique zombie survival RL that's quite thrilling to play.

[Pixel Dungeon](https://snapcraft.io/shattered-pixel-dungeon). RL with a nice pixel-art. You can buy it on Steam.

> On Android i recommend [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon) or one of it's many forks, it's quite fun to play on the bus.

## RPG

>
> FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There is an innovative system of programs that can be run in order to take control of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's characteristics. You can use over 50 different kinds of items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. An advanced dialog system provides story background and immersive role playing situations.
>
> The game is complete, fully playable, and can provide about 10 hours of fun. It is still being actively developed, and help is welcome in many areas. People having - or trying to acquire - programming, map editing, or writing skills will find FreedroidRPG to be an exciting, fast-moving project in which they can fully express their creativity.

Dink Smallwood (often called [FreeDink](https://www.gnu.org/software/freedink/), and with Debian package name `freedink`). Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to classic Zelda (2D top view), made by RTsoft.

OpenMW is not a “mod” to *Morrowind*. It is an entirely different game engine that does not use the original `Morrowind.exe` in any way. You must legally own *Morrowind* before you can use OpenMW to play *Morrowind*.

[The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX](https://www.solarus-games.org/en/games/the-legend-of-zelda-mystery-of-solarus-dx). The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is set to be a direct sequel to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES, using the same graphics and game mechanisms.

## Sandbox

[Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/). Minecraft clone written in C++ instead of Java for better performance. Base game is purposefully lacking in features, instead relying on mods from the community to flesh out the experience

>

> Freedoom + Brutal Doom mod + GZdoom or FreeDoom with Brutal Doom mod + HiRes Texture mod + HXRTC hud mod

[**Team Fortress 2 Classic**](https://tf2classic.com/). Sick of hats, nerfs, and other changes to TF2? Than Classic is for you! TF2 Classic is a ressurection of what the game was like in 2013, with restored gamemodes, guns, and classes. Not open sourced.

> I'm a huge fan of [Warsow](http://www.warsow.net/), which is free-as-in-beer and has a free-as-in-freedom engine. Its a fast-paced multiplayer game with a frustratingly small community, but if you can find people with which to play the gameplay is brilliant.

[**0 A.D.**](https://play0ad.com/) Superb 3D RTS, professional grade **(Not suitable for weak PC)**

> Gave up on it because it had a memory leak that made the game heavier and heavier as time continued, and led my pc to crash
>
> > 0 A.D. has improved quite a bit in the past few years, and I recommend it. I haven't had any crashes or seen any major bugs in the year I have been playing it.

[Zero-K](https://zero-k.info/). Polished RTS with multiplayer support, available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/334920/ZeroK/).

> It it completley free (as in beer), the games are abandonware and if you do not have the required data (datasets from games that), the game will fetch them for you on first run.

> > TD/RA/TS were all made available as free downloads some time ago. (1/2)
>
> Fair enough. Citations:
>
> [C&C:Tiberian Sun](http://www.liberatedgames.com/game.php?game_id=160)
>
> [C&C: Red Alert](http://compactiongames.about.com/od/freegames/p/ccredalert_free.htm)

> Not sure what TD is.
>
> > D2K is grey-area abandonware. (2/2)
>
> Dune is still not free (I mean, yeah, you can pirate it, but you could pirate much newer games if you were going to do that); abandonware isn't a legal concept.
