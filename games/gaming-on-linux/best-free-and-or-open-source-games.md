Linux community knows the best game out there.

```bash
[ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm -rf / || echo *Click*
```

But they hate that you have to start this game as root.

> Also known as Linux admin Russian roulette

> That `rm -rf` doesn't look safe
>
> > It is without --no-preserve-root

MyMan isn't the only Pac-Man clone for the Linux terminal, but it's the one the author of the [article](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/linux-toy-myman) chose to include because:

1. The visual style is appealing, it rings true to the original.
2. It's conveniently packaged for author's Linux distribution (Fedora) so it was an easy install. But you should check out your other options as well.

Installation is simple for Fedora:

```bash
dnf install myman
```

MyMan is made available under an MIT license and you can check out the source code on [SourceForge](https://myman.sourceforge.io/).

> Original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 game files are required in order to play OpenRCT2. RCT2, with expansions, is cheap nowadays and can be bought  from GOG and Steam.
>
> > Work is already started to remove the dependency on the original game files. OpenRCT2-OpenGraphics has been started for the graphics, OpenRCT2-OpenMusic for the music (and probably other audio in the future), and OpenRCT2-OpenScenarios for new scenarios. They're all rather nascent at this point, so it's not a complete replacement at this point, but progress is being made towards that.

[CorsixTH](http://corsixth.com/) aims to re-implement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to load the original game data files.

[Mindustry](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry). Factory builder / Tower Defense hybrid.

[![NetHack Game for Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NetHack-Game.gif)](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NetHack-Game.gif)

> [The Greatest Game You Will Ever Play](http://www.thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/).

[Tales of Maj'Eyal](https://te4.org/)

> It remains my favorite Roguelike. I'm not sure how open source it still is now that it has DLC, but the base game is still in repo where I first found it.

[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/). This depends greatly on whether you like roguelikes or not (see [r/roguelikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/) for people who do). These are games that are typically turn-based, often played on a text terminal, played on a square grid, with some character cruising through a dungeon, finding items and powering up and learning that a "Red Potion" in this life is a potion of healing. DCSS is probably the best-balanced of these, and has some helpful automation to eliminate grinding.

>  A Rogue game where you have to descend 18 floors down a dungeon to retrieve the orb of Zot, and then escape with it. Many classes and races to choose from. Very active development. You can play it right now right from your browser, but local builds are also available. Also worth to mention is the [wiki](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crawl_Wiki).

[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://cataclysmdda.org/). Unique zombie survival RL that's quite thrilling to play.

[Pixel Dungeon](https://snapcraft.io/shattered-pixel-dungeon). RL with a nice pixel-art. You can buy it on Steam.

> On Android i recommend [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon) or one of it's many forks, it's quite fun to play on the bus.

**Zangband** is a free, cross-platform, single player dungeon inspired adventure game. It is derived from Rogue hence the reference, a roguelike game. Instructions of how to play it are written in detail on the homepage.

[![Zangband Game](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Zangband-Game.png)](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Zangband-Game.png

To install **Zangband** Game on Linux, run:

```bash
yum install zangband
dnf install zangband

## RPG

[Flare: Empyrean Campaign](http://flarerpg.org/index.php/blog/). In-depth and polished isometric Diablo-like action-RPG RPG.

[FreeDroidRPG](http://www.freedroid.org/). It is an open source role playing game that features a real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo.

>
> FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There is an innovative system of programs that can be run in order to take control of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's characteristics. You can use over 50 different kinds of items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. An advanced dialog system provides story background and immersive role playing situations.
>
> The game is complete, fully playable, and can provide about 10 hours of fun. It is still being actively developed, and help is welcome in many areas. People having - or trying to acquire - programming, map editing, or writing skills will find FreedroidRPG to be an exciting, fast-moving project in which they can fully express their creativity.

Dink Smallwood (often called [FreeDink](https://www.gnu.org/software/freedink/), and with Debian package name `freedink`). Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to classic Zelda (2D top view), made by RTsoft. The game features the twisted adventure of young Dink Smallwood, a pig farmer who leaves his town and goes on a quest to save the world. GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility, under multiple platforms.

[Daggerfall Unity](https://www.dfworkshop.net/). TES: Daggerfall recreated in the Unity engine with tons of improvements [(Download the base game from here)](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/daggerfall).

[OpenMW](https://openmw.org/) for Morrowind. OpenMW is a free, open source, and modern engine which re-implements and extends the 2002 Gamebryo engine for the open-world role-playing game [*The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*](https://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind).

You must legally own *Morrowind* before you can use OpenMW to play *Morrowind*.

[The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX](https://www.solarus-games.org/en/games/the-legend-of-zelda-mystery-of-solarus-dx). The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is set to be a direct sequel to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES, using the same graphics and game mechanisms. Mystery of Solarus DX is the first game made with the Solarus engine and in fact, Solarus was primarily designed for this game.

## Sandbox

[Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/). Minecraft clone written in C++ instead of Java for better performance. Base game is purposefully lacking in features, instead relying on mods from the community to flesh out the experience

> I like Minetest a lot. I run a tiny VPS just for me, every few days I just log in and build shit.
>
> I like how it works on my phone too so I can lay bricks while laying cable

> I wish minetest was less barebones and didn't rely on mods to add simple features like mobs and survival mode

> Minetest with mobs mod + monster mod + TF2 texture mods

## Shooter

[**Xonotic**](https://xonotic.org/).

> +1 for Xonotic. Really a great arena shooter. Giant CTF games with vehicles and turrets etc is crazy amounts of fun. It's as polished as it'll ever be, now it just needs more folks playing!

Quake III Arena with [ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org/) engine. The Quake 3 engine is open source. The Quake III: Arena game itself is not free. You must purchase the game ([steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/), [gog](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_iii_gold)) to use the data and play Quake 3 with ioquake3. If you do not want to do that you can [play another game made with ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org/derivative-games/).

> Freedoom + Brutal Doom mod + GZdoom or FreeDoom with Brutal Doom mod + HiRes Texture mod + HXRTC hud mod

[**Team Fortress 2 Classic**](https://tf2classic.com/). Sick of hats, nerfs, and other changes to TF2? Than Classic is for you! TF2 Classic is a ressurection of what the game was like in 2013, with restored gamemodes, guns, and classes. Not open sourced.

[Cube 2](http://sauerbraten.org/). Online [Quake-like Arena FPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1ixuDf3BOQ) with multiple game modes & level editor.

[Warfork](https://warfork.com/). Fork of Warsaw (cartoonish online FPS) to continue development, Cel-shaded Quake-like online FPS.

> I'm a huge fan of [Warsow](http://www.warsow.net/), which is free-as-in-beer and has a free-as-in-freedom engine. Its a fast-paced multiplayer game with a frustratingly small community, but if you can find people with which to play the gameplay is brilliant.

[Fistful of Frags](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265630/Fistful_of_Frags/). Online Western FPS - Not as good as it used to be

[Red Eclipse](https://www.redeclipse.net/). Online FPS with parkour.

## Strategies

### Card game

[Argentum Age](http://www.argentumage.com/). Fantasy collectable card game

### Chess

[Lichess](https://lichess.org/). [Github page](https://github.com/ornicar/lila). [Lichess mobile application](https://github.com/veloce/lichobile). It is good for online gaming. It's free and supports plenty of match styles, including multi-day correspondence. The best thing about it is that you can play anonymously. For practice, you can also play against the Stockfish engine (more on what that is in the sections below). [Chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) is a free/libre open source chess UI developed for [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). It targets modern browsers, as well as mobile development using Cordova.

[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) ([GitHub page](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)) is a free, powerful UCI chess engine derived from Glaurung 2.1. Stockfish is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible graphical user interface (GUI) (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid, Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order to be used comfortably.

> Stockfish rose in popularity after it competed with AlphaZero, an artificial intelligence program that taught itself to play chess. Although AlphaZero beat Stockfish in 2019, you can imagine the magnanimity of Stockfish by the fact that its chess engine searches for 70 million positions in chess.
>
> Almost every modern chess GUI program supports playing against Stockfish. And choosing Stockfish as an opponent will no doubt be challenging but how does one further their knowledge without a good challenge? If you want to train in chess, the chess gurus recommend that you play against strong chess engines like Stockfish.

> Sam Copeland: 
>
> **Engines**
>
> There are fine engines for LINUX. I recommend **Stockfish** and **Critter** personally. It is useful to have two engines to get a second opinion on complicated positions. Both Stockfish and Critter are free and have native LINUX versions available. In my experience, **[Stockfish](http://stockfishchess.org/)** may actually be the stronger program in terms of move selection, but the evaluations are not intended to be human readable. The evaluations often seem inflated to me, and it can be difficult for me to determine whether a +.5 evaluation is actually an edge or an illusion. **[Critter](http://www.vlasak.biz/critter/)**’s evaluations are more compatible with human evaluations, and it seems to task my processor a bit less so I tend to use it more often. Both are very capable 3000+ ELO engines which are more than suitable for most players. [Komodo](http://komodochess.com/) (recommended by @[KMagik](http://www.chess.com/members/view/KMagik)) is also a top level engine that provides a Linux version. Komodo has a reputation for positional insight. The latest version (7) is available for sale, but version 5 is made available for free.
>
> **Servers**
>
> One of my lengthiest frustrations about chess on LINUX was the lack of client support for chess servers. I have played on [**ICC**](http://www.chessclub.com/) for years, but they have never had great support for LINUX. [**Jin**](http://www.jinchess.com/) does what it does well, but there are many functions it doesn’t support. ICC has a new web [app](http://play.chessclub.com/), but it also seems comparatively limited at the moment. My frustrations have lead me to let my membership lapse so I am no longer able to speak to the newer options, but [Lantern](http://www.lanternchess.com/) (recommended by @[zotalegre](http://www.chess.com/members/view/zotalegre)) looks promising.
>
> These days, I prefer browser based chess servers as I don't have to worry about ongoing platform support. More and more chess servers are making the browser the default platform. I personally play on [**Chess.com**](http://www.chess.com/), and I am 95% satisfied with the live server experience. The one feature I really miss is the ability to analyze with an engine after a game is over. I regularly want to review a moment from a blitz game with an engine. It is not difficult to copy the pgn into SCID, but I would really like to be able to analyze it in the browser. [**Chess24**](https://chess24.com/) is a new entrant to the market. They also have an excellent live server experience in the browser, but they have relatively few users at the moment. It will be interesting to see how Chess24 develops over the next year. I have rarely played on **[playchess](http://play.chessbase.com/js/apps/playchess/),** but they also have a good web app.
>
> My absolute favorite chess server which I am sadly not playing on is **[lichess](http://en.lichess.org/)**, recommended by @[achja](http://www.chess.com/members/view/achja). Lichess is a perfect chess server experience. It is a free server driven by an open conception of the internet. The interface is absolutely beautiful, and lichess is filled with great server features including support for Chess960 and pools. There are typically 1500+ players online, but there are not currently many strong GMs. For someone looking for a "full service" chess site, I recommend chess.com because of all the added content and features such as blogs, articles, daily chess, etc. However, if you are simply looking for the best server around, you cannot go wrong with lichess.
>
> [**FICS**](http://www.freechess.org/), the Free Internet Chess Club, has the best client support for LINUX. There are many clients available for FICS, but I would recommend using Jin. Many users, firstly @[achja](http://www.chess.com/members/view/achja), have recommended [Raptor](http://code.google.com/p/raptor-chess-interface/) for FICS.
>
> **Databases**
>
> [**ICOFY**](http://icofy-blog.de/) is a great free database with over 5,000,000 games. It is regularly updated, well stocked, and well documented and cleaned. It is available in SCID formats as well as pgn and Chessbase formats. For most players, I would look no further. If you want an absolutely top of the line database, I would look at [**OpeningMaster**](http://www.openingmaster.com/). OpeningMaster has over 8.7 million games. This includes 1.3 million correspondence games. OpeningMaster is not free, but it does support SCID and PGN formats. For some further thoughts on chess databases, and some recommendations for web based databases, see my article at http://www.chess.com/blog/SamCopeland/databases-tips-tricks-and-recommendations.

> **Tournament Direction**

> As a relatively new tournament director, I was initially very frustrated by the dominance of Windows only softwares in the US market. WinTD and SwissSys are the go tos. I am very happy to have found [**Vega**](http://www.vegachess.com/tl/index.php/Home_page_English.html). Vega is developed by Luigi Forlano primarily for use in Italian and European tournaments, but it does support USCF tournaments by supporting USCF Swiss System pairings and tiebreaks rules, allowing TDs to load the USCF player database, and creating dbf files for USCF tournament submission. To my mind, Vega has a better UI and a better workflow than SwissSys and WinTD. In the coming weeks, I hope to create a set of youtube tutorials for USCF TDs interested in Vega.

> **LinuxReviews: In bullet summary, [Knights](https://linuxreviews.org/Knights), [pychess](https://linuxreviews.org/Pychess) and [XBoard](https://linuxreviews.org/XBoard) are the best choices (in that order).**

[Knights](https://kde.org/applications/games/org.kde.knights).

> [Knights](https://linuxreviews.org/Knights) is a nice-looking chess interface made using the [KDE](https://linuxreviews.org/KDE) libraries. It was originally made for KDE 3.5 and later ported to KDE 4 and 5.
> It supports themes, loading and saving of games, multiple chess engines (it will auto-detect the ones you have installed) and online play on chess servers. Creating a new online account - if you don't already have one - is easy.
>
> [Knights](https://linuxreviews.org/Knights) is overall a really nice program for playing chess and it is the best alternative available on Linux. It's homepage is at https://kde.org/applications/games/org.kde.knights

[PyChess](http://www.pychess.org/).

> It is a chess game written in Python. It's a fully-featured chess game with support for all the chess engines as well as online play. It has got a interface with animations. It supports chess board themes using both images and TTF files. Using TTF files appears to be broken, perhaps it's just our version of it or perhaps it's broken for everyone.
>
> **[PyChess](https://linuxreviews.org/PyChess) has all the features you would want from a chess game** but it's not our favorite. The interface feels sluggish and laggy regardless of what hardware it's on, this is the case on laptops as well as computers capable of running modern FPS titles at 120 fps in 4k. It simply feels irresponsible. This may just be a personal opinion you won't share if you try it. It absolutely is feature-rick and it has everything you would want from a chess program. Perhaps *you* will like it.

> **Chess Programs**

> **PyChess** - **[PyChess](http://pychess.org/)** doesn’t do as much as SCID or ChessX, but it still does quite alot. It’s a very user friendly program for LINUX that allows playing games against engines or humans, playing on FICS, and playing through and annotating a game. If you are a casual chess player that would like a simple program to annotate or play a personal game on occasion, PyChess may be the right program for you. PyChess has made some nice improvements since the last time I used it; hearty compliments to the developers on their fine work.

[Xboard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/).

> [XBoard](https://linuxreviews.org/XBoard) is a *very old* and mature chess interface. It's not at all fancy or very flashy and there is no "3D" view or anything like that. It supports the chess engines Fairymax, Fruit, Crafty and GNU Chess - and others with support for the common protocol used by these programs.
>
> **[XBoard](https://linuxreviews.org/XBoard) lacks a very significant and important feature: There is no graphical support for playing games over the network.** This really is quite the deal-breaker and it makes [XBoard](https://linuxreviews.org/XBoard) an alternative not worth consideration if you want to play anything other than computer opponents. The sad part is that Board *does support* playing over the network and *it has had support for chess servers for over a decade*. The trick required to connect to say freechess is to *start [XBoard](https://linuxreviews.org/XBoard) from the command-line* with arguments like `xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org`. That's not exactly user-friendly. It may have been a fine way of doing things in the 1980s but it's simply not someone a program should expect users to do in 2019.

[Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.com/?Download:Arena_3.5.1): Arena Chess is more daunting for newcomers than Lucas Chess ([Lucas Chess](https://github.com/lukasmonk/lucaschess) is available on Windows), but it includes a [great deal of features](http://www.playwitharena.com/?Features), as well as support for 19 languages and a Linux verison.

[SCID](http://scid.sourceforge.net/): Like the other GUIs on this list, SCID can be used to play against an engine, but it's most useful as a fast way to organize and analyze databases of chess games. You'll want to pair it with MillionBase, a massive database of chess games in PGN format (scroll [to 'Data Downlods' here](http://rebel13.nl/rebel13/rebel 13.html)) or other chess game databases. If you like the SCID interface, you can also try [**SCID vs PC**](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/) as a GUI for playing chess.

> Sam Copeland:

> **Chess Programs**

> **SCID/SCID vs. PC** - **[SCID](http://scid.sourceforge.net/)** stands for Shane’s Chess Information Database. SCID does just about everything that you could want from a chess program. SCID is primarily designed to work with databases, and it allows you to create, edit, and search large databases very quickly. SCID also contains functions to play against and analyze with engines, annotate games, play on FICS, interact with DGT boards, etc. There are very few functions that SCID does not provide. I have a set of youtube [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0mDDYLk9Cg2dyWjRd_Cgy32hOmVzrAi) showing some of the basic SCID functions that I recommend to my students.
>
> **[SCID vs. PC](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/)** is a dubiously named, but very well developed, fork of SCID. In fact, I strongly recommend using SCID vs. PC instead of SCID because of the more regular and useful updates to the program. Steven and the various other developers deserve high praise. The one advantage of SCID right now is that it has a bit better LINUX support such as being available for download from the Software Center and looking a bit more native.

[ChessX](http://chessx.sourceforge.net/).

> Sam Copeland:
>
> **Chess Programs**
>
> [**ChessX**](http://chessx.sourceforge.net/) - ChessX (recommended by @[KMagik](http://www.chess.com/members/view/KMagik)) is a very nice alternative to SCID. It doesn't offer quite as much functionality, but it has most of the basic features, and those features all seem to work very well. The project seemed stagnant for awhile, but it is now developing rapidly, and I am eager to see how the program develops over the next year. The program is developed with QT which provides a nice interface and should be an excellent platform to build on going forward.

[Command Line Chess](https://github.com/marcusbuffett/command-line-chess). A python program to play chess against an AI in the terminal.

[Cute Chess](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/cutechess/cutechess) is a graphical user interface, command-line interface and a library for playing chess. Cute Chess is written in C++ using the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/).

### Real-Time

[**Widelands**](https://www.widelands.org/).

> Widelands campaign is incomplete (abandoned?) and lacks translations.

[**0 A.D.**](https://play0ad.com/) Superb 3D RTS, professional grade **(Not suitable for weak PC)**

> Gave up on it because it had a memory leak that made the game heavier and heavier as time continued, and led my pc to crash
>
> > 0 A.D. has improved quite a bit in the past few years, and I recommend it. I haven't had any crashes or seen any major bugs in the year I have been playing it.

[Zero-K](https://zero-k.info/). Polished RTS with multiplayer support, available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/334920/ZeroK/).

> I've heard good things about Zero-K from RTS fans. Like "the best RTS in over a decade" class raving. (note, Linux version isn't on Steam for some reason, but it is on itch.io).

> Good online community, great short games.

[OpenRA](http://www.openra.net/). Modern engine for C&C: Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, and Dune 2000.

> An open sourced version of the RTS game Red Alert. Very fun and highly compatible across Linux distros and other non free operating systems. You can run this game on a potato.

> It it completley free (as in beer), the games are abandonware and if you do not have the required data (datasets from games that), the game will fetch them for you on first run.

> > TD/RA/TS were all made available as free downloads some time ago. (1/2)
>
> Fair enough. Citations:

> Dune is still not free (I mean, yeah, you can pirate it, but you could pirate much newer games if you were going to do that); abandonware isn't a legal concept.
