# Best missions and maps

## Best missions (from best to worst)

- Ground Zeroes: camp Omega is the best outpost in the game and the story is polished (and finished).
- 28: Code Talker: the mission has two ways to complete - beat Skulls, infiltraltrate the mansion and get around soldiers, or  get around Skulls, infiltrate the mansion and get around Skulls again. Also the mansion gives unique indoor experience and the jungle gives unique outdoor experience.
- 30: Skullface: OKB Zero is the best outpost in the TPP, also Skullface is great character.
- 31: Sahelanthropus: the best Metal Gear fight in the series, there are many ways to destroy Sally.
- 43: Shining Lights, Even in Death: the most emotional mission in the game.
All side-ops and extra-ops from MGS V: Ground zeroes.
- 49: [Subsistence] Occupation Forces: Sakhra Ee Village has unique level design, also you can complete missions with weapons OSP.
- 13: Pitch Dark: outpost is awesome.
- 10: Angel with Broken Wings: you can complete this mission in one minute or you can infiltrate two interesting outposts (palace and supply post) with high security and save all hostages. Supply post is great place to infiltrate especially in day.
- 11: Cloaked in Silence: basically the only sniper duel in MGS V. You can shoot Quiet with rifle or you can use CQC. Also decoys are useful: she starts to panic when see a lot of Snakes :)
- 14: Lingua Franca: if you follow the interpreter you will get great small story about Vincent and his comrades, also Kiziba camp has many great details such as suppressors, rounds and great landscape with swamp where you can blend in.
- 33: [Subsistence] C2W: basically mission is very simple but Subsistence makes it even better. You can use grenades, missiles or even mines to destroy equipment.
- 38: Extraordinary: the only mission in the game where you have to analyze picture to find target.
- 1: Phantom Limbs: basically the first open world mission the MGS V but this mission can be easily done with weapons OSP (just like Ground Zeroes missions). All outposts has suppressors.
- 22: Retake the Platform: this mission won’t give you a rank after completion but R&D Platform has unique level design which appears only on FOB missions. You can infiltrate by stairs or use pipes. There many ways to sneak! And the most interesting thing about FOBs is that you could be spotted by people from above or from below which impossible on default missions (exception could be OKB Zero). Also FOB missions with high level of security could give you a great portion of hardcore because they have UAVs and Surveillance cameras. Also enemies have unique fatigues.

## Best outposts

Camp Omega is the best outpost in the MGS V: Ground Zeroes and in the MGS V in general.

> Quote: If the whole of TPP, even if some of the padding for missions was removed, was executed as well as GZ was, it might be hard for me to argue anything else could be my favorite game. The pacing of the gameplay in GZ, because it was just a small vertical slice, was so much better than the majority of TPP.
Realistically, it would be difficult and honestly really unfair to expect ANY open world game to remain consistent and well thought out, but GZ just had all the right elements.
Story-wise, the presentation was nearly flawless. We got lots of little teasers all over the place, both in the main mission and even in the side ops to build up how terrifying Skull Face and what he was capable of. The cassette tapes all went way out of their way to solidify this. Even if no main plot threads were changed in TPP, I think it and the ending would've been much better received if TPP's story presentation wasn't so scarce and actually lived up to how well GZ did things.
Gameplay-wise, despite having less mechanics and them not being quite as tight/polished as they were in TPP (IMO, I hear people argue about GZ CQC being superior but I don't understand that), the level design of Camp Omega is what makes playing that main mission and those side ops feel so damn good every time. If there were several major areas with the care put into/sheer scale of Camp Omega in TPP, the game would've been outright, objectively better than the huge amount of space we got that, like most open-world games, ends up being largely empty and just passed on by after many hours of playtime.
I still think overall TPP is a more fun experience just with the sheer amount of things you can do and fun you can have with all the elements not present in GZ: but GZ is a better designed, better executed game. GZ's design philosophy and execution being expanded even to only about 50% of TPP's scale would've been an absolutely MONSTROUS game that may have even forced companies to rethink how they carry out "open world" from that point on. We have enough empty, lifeless sandbox games. A really well done one might have soured some people on those and forced other developers to step up their game.

Afghanistan:

- Sakhra Ee Village
- OKB Zero
- Afghanistan Central base camp: there are many holes in this base but I like that - OSP is possible on this outpost
- Yahoo Oboo supply post

Africa:

- Lufwa Valley mansion
- Kiziba Camp
- Mfinda Oilfield: it’s pity that this outpost has no surveillance cameras 

Top of the FOB platforms:

- R&D platform: so many places to infiltrate or to hide
- Main platform: two-three ways to sneak but there many ways to get spotted from above.
- Combat platform: just like Main platform but smaller.
- Support platform: there are many interesting places to hide but they all aren’t useful because target is so easy to reach.
- Intel Platform: really hard platform, noctocianin could be useful
Medical Platform: no so many places to hide, you could sneak using C4.
