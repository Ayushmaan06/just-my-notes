Games have started to be boring for me. I've played a lot of FPS games or any other AAA games. They are all so similiar and I just wanna try something original, innovative and generally fun games. Therefore I wanna try indie games since they're very different from the FPS genre so... what is the best indie games you have played?

> 30: No indie library is complete without "Limbo" and "Papers, Please"

> 25: **FTL** - a bit tough, but keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly. You are always one unlucky moment away from failure while remaining in control.
>
> ...
>
> The newest one is The Hat in Time - great platformer that has the right mix of Mario 64 nostalgia with a bit of Psychonauts.

> 26: The 'best' for me is suuuuper hard to pinpoint, but IMO, here are some must-plays you should start with:
>
> 1. Super Meat Boy
> 2. Braid
> 3. Bastion
> 4. The Stanley Parable
> 5. **Stardew Valley**
> 6. **Hollow Knight**
> 7. Hotline Miami
> 8. Journey (this one is a playstation exclusive)
> 9. Cuphead
> 10. *Cave Story+*
> 11. The Room 1, 2, and 3
> 12. *Ori and the* Blind Forest
> 13. *Shovel Knight*: Treasure Trove
> 14. Rocket League
> 15. The Talos Principle
>
> And there's a looooooot more where that came from! Take your pick. All of them are fantastic, interesting, and something you'd never see in AAA games nowdays.

> 13: **Factorio**. Professional developers, excellent back-and-forth with the community, well designed and extremely well programmed game, excellent mod support, online multiplayer, private server hosting, continual updates and bugfixes, reasonable price... and the last but not the least, an extremely addictive and fun game.
>
> It's to what all indie devs should strive towards.

> 12: ,,,Enter the gungeon“ is the best indie game ive played in my entire life and ive played a lot

> 10: No mention of **Rimworld** yet? Fits all criteria I think and was a one man show for a long time

> 6: **Factorio**

> 6: My favorites are
>
> *Don't starve* A rougelike survival horror game with a ton of depth to it and a really fun art style
>
> Oxenfree A fun adventure story game with a lot of fun humor, good voice acting and beautiful art
>
> *Undertale* An interesting take on an RPG where you really can charm your way through the game or become a cold blooded killer. Characters react accordingly
>
> If you could only buy one I'd say get *don't starve* as you'll get the most time for your money

>  7: The binding of issac is the only game i consistently played and enjoyed for years before 1001% it

>  4: I see a lot of the common suggestions here eg meat Boy, *don't starve*, **FTL** etc so I skipped the obvious and listed some which are *mostly* not as well known except for a few (like bastion)

What is the best indie game you have ever played?

> 73: **Hollow Knight**, it's also probably one of the best games in general that I've ever played.

> 56: **RimWorld**

> 50: Minecraft and it isn't even close. This indie game grew bigger than just about any AAA game but was quite indie at first.

> 39: **Stardew Valley** for me. Hate gardening and fishing in real life. There it's so peaceful.

> 33: **Factorio**

> 35: *Terraria*

> 28: **Rimworld** or **FTL**.

> 19: Dead Cells...although the Steamworld games (dig, dig2 and Heist) are good too.

> 16: *Darkest Dungeon* *Dwarf Fortress* Deep rock Galactic Foxhole

> 16: *Enter The Gungeon*

> 16: *Don't Starve*.

> 12: *Cave Story*, without a doubt. Not only the best indie game, but also best game I’ve ever played.

> 11: *Ori and the Blind Forest*

> 12: It is a tie between **FTL**, Slay the Spire and Hyper Light Drifter. Had a blast with all of them.

> 12: A Hat In Time

> 9: *Terraria* probably. And that was before most of the big updates.
>
> Second would probably be **factorio**.

> 8: Firewatch! That game never gets enough love

---

What Indie Games do you consider to be must plays?

>  42: **FTL**: Faster Than Light, hands down!
>
> > 7: Easily the most hours I've put into any indie game. Every year or two I come back and play it a bunch more when I'm feeling a Star Trek itch. The way you scramble your crew when things are going pear-shaped is amazing. There have been several imitations since it's release, but no one else has gotten it quite right.
> >
> > I wish I could get another expansion for it, I love the core systems of that game.

> 26: **Factorio** has kept me up into the early morning several times. It's a game about building things to build other things that you use to build more things that build things.
>
> The Fall is a really compelling short adventure game. Maybe wait for a sale if you're price-conscious. Awesome story where you are a robot trying to get around your own programming.
>
> *Fez* is a magical puzzly platformery game about exploring 3 dimensions from the pespective of two-dimensional people. Everyone should play this. The dimension mechanics are amazing.
>
> Mark of the Ninja is an amazing side scrolling action stealth game. If you have any appreciation for ninjas, you gotta try this out. The sound and shadow mechanics are top-notch.
>
> Invisible Inc from the same studio, Klei. Procedural, turn-based stealth game. I put a lot of time into this one, it's fantastic. Deterministic, so there's no % chances used in this game. It's one-hit kills but you don't do a lot of fighting. It's mostly about sneaking *around* the impediments using a cyber-noire assortment of keybreakers and disguises and hacking. Fucking rad game once you get passed the initial couple hours of learning curve and internalize the mechanics. Hint: just because you *can* knock someone out doesn't mean you *should*. It's better to just sneak around them if you can.
>
> Divinity Original Sin pretty high production for "indie" but it is an independent studio working with kickstarter money. They just came out with an amazing sequel but the original game is also excellent. Strategy turn based combat with a very interesting elemental system with lots of fun interactions (Water puts out fire and creates steam clouds which limit visibility, for example).
>
> Grow Home is a 3d platformer that harkens back to the olden days of the 90s when this genre was big. I don't really care for the genre myself, but this game is quite endearing. Fun climbing mechanics in a short, but tight and appropriately priced experience.
>
> Hyper Light Drifter was my favorite game that year. Combat was tight as hell. Very minimalist story but in an intriguing way. Best pixel art I've ever seen. Secrets on secrets on secrets. 100% full recommendation.

> 17: Crypt of the Necrodancer melds roguelike and rhythm game beautifully. Heck, it's worth a buy for the soundtrack alone.
>
> *Undertale* - cancerous fandom aside - is also a really good game, with likable characters, and a bombass soundtrack.
>
> Evoland 2 is one of the most unique RPGs you'll ever play. (Evoland 1 isn't all that. The sequel is great though)
>
> Clustertruck for frenetic, high energy, short burst gameplay that's fun.
>
> Party Hard for (surprisingly) one of the best stealth/assassination games, especially in 2D
>
> Divekick for a very memey, genre parodying, but solid fighting game.
>
> Nitronic Rush for an amazing racing/platforming game. (Just a note- it's not available on Steam. It's a free download from the developers site, though)
>
> And a note to the OP: Browse sites like Gamejolt and itch.io on the regular if you're interested in indie games. There's a lot of shovelware, true, but you'll also find plenty of creative ideas and hidden gems this way.
>
> > 6: I agree, the soundtrack of Crypt of the Necrodancer is fantastic! I feel like that needs to be shared more.

> 16: Spelunky - Indiana Jones-esque sidescroll platformer. One life, with sone permanent progression. Cute graphics, 2D. One man team.
>
> **Stardew Valley** - Harvest Moon but better in every way. Cute graphics, layered three-quarter view 2D. One man team originally, full team working on multiplayer expansion releasing next spring.
>
> *Dwarf Fortress* - Like if the Sims and an anthill had an angry drunken baby. And that baby chose 'base building' as it's form of teen rebellion. Techically early access, about 43% done. Incredibly rich gameplay, deep intetaction of several systems. New versions about once a year. Graphics: top down tiles, 2D 'slices' of a 3D world. You get used to it. Two man team. This game belongs in a museum, and in fact IS in one.
>
> Rogue Legacy - Sidescrolling platformer. Learning enemy attack patterns is everything. Proceedurally generated, so levels are different each time, focus on exploration and boss fights. Cute 2D graphics. Small team.
>
> *Fez* is great, but with all the people that have worked on it, I don't know if you can call it indie. Same with Terarria and Minecraft (both of which drew inspiration from *Dwarf Fortress* above -it's really the granddaddy of procedurally generated gaming at this point).

> 5: Here's a handful of indie games that I found fun and haven't uninstalled them despite playing them thoroughly:
>
> Risk of Rain: A rogue-like 2D survival game with tons of abilities and classes with unique abilities. Spent a lot of time on this one. It has RNG elements when it comes to item upgrades and with the different classes it keeps things fresh for a long time.
>
> Salt and Sanctuary: 2D Dark Souls. Excellent atmosphere and rewarding gameplay.
>
> Lisa: This game will fuck you up emotionally. Simple turn based RPG with a pretty crazy story. Play with caution.
>
> Hacknet: Here's a bachelors in Computer Science. Except it's a game.
>
> There's a few more in the box, but most people have already mentioned it or it's dead/not solo friendly.
>
> **Stardew Valley**, *Terraria*, Crea, Depth, Screencheat, GRIP, *Undertale*

> 4: Steamworld Dig 1/2 - The first one is a few years old and can be downloaded for cheap. It's fairly short but has addictive gameplay and is a lot of fun. I'm currently playing the 2nd one so I can't say much about it, but it seems to be improved in every aspect compared to the 1st one

> 5: Braid, Axiom Verge, Legend of Grimrock, Inside, Limbo, Thomas was alone, Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, Hyper Light Drifter, Divinity Original Sin 2, Rock of Ages 2, The Stanley Parable, *Darkest Dungeon*, Super Hot, Papers Please, Salt and Sanctuary, **Hollow Knight**, *Enter the Gungeon*. There's so many greats.

> 4: OneShot. That game flew under the radar, but it does amazing things no other game does. If you like smash, then Rivals of Aether is definitely worth a look. Stanley parable has been mentioned, but he successor (The Beginner's Guide) is definitely worth your time as well.

> 3: **FTL**
>
> *Undertale*
>
> *Shovel Knight*
>
> Azure Striker Gunvolt
>
> Freedom Planet
>
> *Fez*
>
> The Stanley Parable

> 3: Journey.

> 3: I'm a big fan of challenging platformers, so I have to recommend:
>
> *Shovel Knight*, basically a collection of 3 (soon to be 4!) different campaigns with solid controls, witty and funny dialogue, and simple, yet great stories that gripped me until the end.
>
> Super Meat Boy, a hard as nails platformer that requires a ton of precision jumping and patience, yet is super rewarding and enjoyable, with a great art style.
>
> Hope these 2 haven't been mentioned yet.
