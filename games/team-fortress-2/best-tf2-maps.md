# Best TF2 maps

## Best Halloween maps

Top tier:

- Perks - arena perks
- Corruption - pl (asylum, really good level design and art direction)
- Slime - koth (w/ spells and mobs, good atmosphere)
- Monster Manor - cp
- Cursed Cove - player destruction
- Farmageddon - player destruction
- Harvest Event - koth
- Pit of Death - player destruction
- Hassle Castle - payload (Upward)
- Los Muertos - koth

I liked personally:

- Spineyard - pl (ok map, w/ mobs)
- Woods - zi (I think it's the best map for this mod, b/c two teams has approximately equal chances to win on it)
- Graveyard - arena
- Megalo - koth (snipers, engies on roofs; depends on a lobby)
- Monster Bash - player destruction
- Eyeduct - koth
- Carnival of Carnage - player destruction
- Sinshine - cp
- Ghoulpit - pl (Sludgepit)
- Soul-mill - koth
- Laughter - koth

I definitly don't want to play on these maps:

- Hellstone - pl (and all of the "stone" maps + Terror, although I think I liked Brimstone)
- Erebus - cp
- Spookeyridge - cp (terrible endp)
- Helltrain - ctf
- Crasher - ctf (but with giants)
- Slasher - kotf (boring layout, spell spam)
- Precipice - pl (long sniper sidelines and corridors, super chokey)
- Bonesaw - pl race.
