# Best TF2 maps

## Best Halloween maps

Top tier:

- Monster Manor - cp
- Cursed Cove - player destruction
- Farmageddon - player destruction
- Harvest Event - koth
- Pit of Death - player destruction
- Laughter - koth
- Hassle Castle - payload (Upward)
- Los Muertos - koth

I liked personally:

- Graveyard - arena
- Monster Bash - player destruction
- Eyeduct - koth
- Carnival of Carnage - special delivery
- Sinshine - cp
- Ghoulpit - pl (Sludgepit)
- Soul-mill - koth

I definitly don't want to play on these maps:

- Megalo - koth (trains, snipers, engies on roofs)
- Hellstone - pl (and all of the "stone" maps + Terror, although I think I liked Brimstone)
- Erebus - cp
- Spookeyridge - cp (terrible endp)
- Helltrain - ctf
- Crasher - ctf (but with giants)
- Slasher - kotf (boring layout, spell spam)
- Precipice - pl (long sniper sidelines and corridors, super chokey)
