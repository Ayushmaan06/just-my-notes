<title>Hitman: Blood Money/General — StrategyWiki, the video game walkthrough and strategy guide wiki</title>
<body>
<p>Most of the basic game mechanics are properly explained in the tutorial, so not everything will be mentioned here.  Only some of the less-clear aspects of the game will be covered.
</p>
<h2>Rankings/Rewards</h2>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>Upon completing a level, you will receive a rating title and bonus cash, depending on how well you carried out your objective.  Although you can definitely approach each mission with a "shoot first, ask questions later" style, the game discourages this kind of behaviour by giving you less cash and lower rankings.  On the other hand, if you manage to get through the mission stealthily, only killing your targets and escaping unseen, you will get more money to be spent on upgrades (see table of contents for more info).
</p><p>The smallest sum of money you can get as a Ranking Bonus is 0$, which is basically what you'll receive for a massive body count and plenty of witnesses...interestingly, if you kill <b>everyone</b> in the level, you actually receive a 1000$ bonus reward.  The highest amount of money you can get is 150,000$, which is awarded for the coveted and difficult to obtain "Silent Assassin" ranking, which can apparently only be obtained if you kill only the specific targets (no bystanders or guards) in a minimum amount of time.
</p><p>Generally, if you wish to obtain high rankings and obtain more money at the end of the level, you'll need to keep your body count as low as possible, and definitely make sure not to get caught killing someone.  Setting off a bomb that kills several people will lower your ranking, obviously, but opening fire with a gun and killing that same number of people will hurt your ranking even more.
</p><p>You should also note that the two primary aspects of your ranking are <b>Noise</b> and <b>Violence</b>.  While you will obviously need to use a little violence in order to complete your mission, unnecessary violence involving non-mission critical NPCs will lower your ranking.  Noise is quite self-evident: firing shotguns or high powered rifles will get you noticed.  Bombs are a major hurt to this category, since they cause a lot of noise, raise much attention, and can likely cause a bit of collateral damage.  Even so, they are the best way to finish off a target in certain cases, so you should use them in some situations, but carefully.

<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>In addition to the rankings, you can also get extra cash rewards based on your performance during a mission.  Factors which determine your final cash purse include:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Objectives</b>: Obviously, completing the primary hit gets you money...this is the biggest factor in your cash reward, even more so than ranking.  For this reason, even if you make critical mistakes in a mission that kill your ranking, but still complete the hit, you'll still rake in a fair sum of cash.  Certain missions have optional objectives that will get you more cash.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Damage Control</b>: The more civilians you kill and the more people witness your acts, the more bribe money the Agency has to pay to cover your tracks.  Note that this is a <b>penalty</b>.  You start off with no sum of money in the Damage Control category, but you'll start losing money, depending on how much chaos you cause (if any).  With enough damage done and enough people killed, this penalty can quite possibly surpass 100,000$.  If you cover your tracks well enough, this should be a minor sum, or cost you nothing at all.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Custom Weapons Retrieval</b>: If you leave behind one of your custom weapons in a mission, you will be charged <b>5,000$</b> to retrieve it.  This fee will be multiplied per weapon.  If you can restrict yourself to the Silverballer and SMG, there should be no problem here, as both weapons are easily concealable.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Suit Retrieval</b>: If you exit a mission wearing anything but the custom-made suit you always start off in, you will be charged a penalty of 5,000$.</li></ul>

<h2>Notoriety</h2>
<p>During each mission, you have the chance to earn "notoriety" based on your actions.  The more witnesses you leave to your actions, the more likely the press and police will publish information about your crimes.  The more notoriety you get (and this adds up level by level), the easier it will be for police, guards, civilians and pretty much any other NPC to recognize your face.  Thus, if you have high notoriety, you can expect the authorities to be much less forgiving of any odd action on your part.  If you manage to max out the notoriety, then most guards or policemen in any given area will simply open fire when they spot you, regardless of what you're doing, thus rendering the possibility to play through the game stealthiliy essentially impossible.
</p><p><b>Here are some key strategies for finishing a mission with little or no notoriety gain:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Leave no witnesses to your crimes.  Try to commit murders out of the line of sight of anyone but yourself and your target.  If someone happens to see you committing a murder, kill them before they manage to escape and raise the alarm.  If you don't outright kill a witness but rather knock them out with your fists or a syringe sedative, make sure to dump their body in a location that isn't regularly visited by NPCs where the body shouldn't be found.  The knocked out NPC will never wake up of his/her own accord, but will be revived if their body is found, and then you've got a witness on your hands and a raised alarm.  More trouble than it's worth, so either hide them well, or if that's not an option, finish them off with a silenced pistol headshot.  The witness rule does not apply if the person is knocked out from behind, as they do not see your face and therefore can't identify you.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Avoid cameras and CCTV monitors.  If you get caught on tape in the vicinity of a murder, regardless of whether the crime is actually caught on tape, you'll raise some unwanted attention.  Either completely avoid cameras (a feat difficult to accomplish on a first runthrough of a mission, as you're not familiarized with the map), or find the security office and steal the tape there to prevent it from being checked.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you happen to obtain a large amount of notoriety during a game, then you'll be able to pay for your sins, so to speak, by purchasing indulgences from the Agency.  If your amount of notoriety is small, then a little hush money paid to the civilians at the scene of the crime should guarantee your security.  If you've been downright genocidal, you'll need to purchase a complete identity makeover.  Very expensive (in the neighbourhood of about 200,000$), but it will wipe the slate clean and allow you to resume your criminal career carefree.</li></ul>
<h3>Special ratings</h3>
<p>There are a couple special ratings (the most simplest is 'Russian Hare'):
<ol>
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Russian Hare - kill with sniper rifle all armed guargs (do not hit innocents) ~ 18 people, maybe covers don't matter
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Needle Pumper - Kill all armed guards with the Nailer (actually you need to kill everyone and get caught on camera)
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Insurance Agent - Kill everyone through accidental means
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Piano man - Kill all armed guards using only your fibre wire
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Insane Florist - Kill handful of armed guards with a Hedge Cutter
<li style="background-color: yellow;"> Sushi Chef - Kill all guards with a knife
<li> King of the Jungle - Kill a handful of people with the Bowie Knife
<li> Swashbuckler - Kill a handful of armed guards with the Cane
<li> Dr Death - Kill a handful of armed guards with your Needles
<li> Skull Splitter - Kill a handful of guards with the Hammer
<li> Raging Blue collar - Kill a handful of guards with the Hammer, but in do not get spotted
<li> Frenzied Firefighter - Kill a handful of guards with the Fire Extinguisher
<li> Evil Eye Gouger - Kill a handful of guards with the Screwdriver
<li> Slugger - Kill everyone with the Baseball Bat
</ol>

<h3>Rated Missions</h3>
<ol>
<li> You Better Watch Out (setting :), interesting ways to set up an incident and infiltrate)
<li> A House of Cards (interesting location which allows you to bring your sniper rifle, also it was hard to achieve Silent Assassin rank)
<li> A New Life (setting + 3 ways to kill target but there are many different ways to infiltrate and steal necklace, also FBI-uniform is easy to get at the start)
<li> Till Death Do Us Part (there are so many ways to kill targets 6-5 but only a few ways to infiltrate - you can just use stealth, father's uniform is the most interesting disguise in the game)
<li> Curtains Down (the best accident kills in this game but there are only a few ways to infiltrat-just choose what worker would you sedate)
<li> Murder of the Crows (crowd, RPG element - you can play as a delivery guy, you need to do your job ASAP while searching your targets which wear funny suits but there are many tech defects)
<li> Flatline (RPG elements: you can play as a patient or you can kill targets as a doctor, also you can just poison your targets) 
<li> A Dance with The Devil (there are a few ways to kill your targets, level is too long but the design is really fantastic)
<li> A Vintage Year (interesting setting, there are 3 ways to kill Don but there are only one (or two if you could use a sniper rifle) to kill second target; also chem-lab exists only as a part of setting)
<li> Amendment XXV (you can put Silverballers into briefcase or throw over the fence; also there are two ways to start=museum_man|bomb_and_museum_uniform but it is really hard to find way to the west wing)
<li> Death on the Missisipi (I like only an escape point and the path to it)
<li> Requiem (just kill everyone if you could stand up :D)
<li> Death of a Showman (boring tutorial)
