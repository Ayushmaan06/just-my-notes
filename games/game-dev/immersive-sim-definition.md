# Immersive Sim definition

From Mark Brown's video: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk)

Immersive Sim:
 - is a design philosophy (but most people call it a genre somehow) 
 - has high levels of AGENCY[ru:путь достижения результата]: 
you can achieve goals in multiple ways. The designers tell you what to do but you choose how to complete this task.
 - is highly SYSTEMIC[ru:систематический]: 
not scripted, system reacts to your decisions (for example, enemy can notice your footsteps, open doors)  
 - is EMERGENT[ru:возникающий]: 
when two systems talk to each other interesting new behaviors can emerge in that way that you can exploit different game's rule and mechanics (for example, you can climb on walls using mines) 
 - is CONSISTENT[ru:последовательный, согласованный]: 
these games try to avoid special cases, there are rarely any failure statues for anything other than getting killed, you won't find these games telling you to return to mission area   
 - is REACTIVE[ru:реактивный, реагирующий]: 
the plot doesn't have to drastically change to reflect your choices, but characters will act in different ways and say different things to reflect on your decisions.  

Also we can describe Immersive Sim as a combination of different genres such as RPG and First Person (for example, FPS). They give us a great immersion. 
But sometimes we can say that Hitman, Gunpoint and other similar games could be Immersive Sim's despite 3rd person because they have great immersion, system that reacts and freedom of choice.

Reddit: "Immersive Systemic Game" is more appropriate name because it emphasizes the importance of system that reacts to player's decisions.
