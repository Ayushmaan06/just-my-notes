Rocket jumping, contrary to popular belief, did NOT start with Quake. Yes, it did get it's start in Doom, however verticality in Rocket  Jumping originated in 2 games that were released on the same day: Rise  of the Triad, and Bungie's Marathon.  Both games featured the ability to shot a rocket at your feet and propel yourself upwards.
