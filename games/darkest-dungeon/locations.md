# Locations

## Ruins

### General description

What you meet there:

- Unholy. Resistances: blood. Remove the Satanophobia quirk before going there.
- Eldritch. Resistances: they like to dodge most of the attacks.
- Human (bandits). Resistances: move (probably).

Type of damage you get:

- Stress. **You will get a lot of Stress in the Ruins!** You should Dodge those attacks (or kill those casters before they do it). Protection and HP aren't that useful in this location.
- Bleeding. Not that scary a thing. Use Plague Doctor's Battlefield Medicine. 

What's on the road:

- Corpses. Remove the appropriate quirk before going there. This is very important, because these corpses basically have nothing useful, and they cause a lot of pain.
- Torture cages. Remove the Bloodthirsty quirk before going there. No matter how afraid I am of opening these cages, most of the time they contain something useful or nothing.
- Shelves of books. Better remove the Curiosity quirk before you go there. Most of the time books add more stress than anything useful.

### Appropriate classes

- Crusader: some abilities have a nice bonus damage against Unholy. Plus, his Inspiring Cry ability can remove some stress.
- Occultist: some abilities have a nice bonus damage against Eldritch. Plus, his Daemon's Pull ability can pull Eldritch or arbalest from the ranged positions. Also, it clears all the corpses which allows Crusader to get those bastards easily.
- Plague Doctor: their Blight and Stun abilities might be useful against armored Unholy and ranged Eldritch (apply Stun on Eldritch and Unholy arbalest to win some time).
- Vestal: melee abilities have a nice bonus damage against Unholy. However, I don't think how this class should be played. **For the first two positions, it is still better to choose Crusader or Hellion.**
- Hellion: I do like her Iron Swan ability that can destroy Eldritch on the 4th position easily. Remember that those Eldritch mobs can dodge her attacks. Some ACC trinkents may help.

Other possible choices:

- Bounty Hunter: I do like his Come Hither ability that can move Eldritch or arbalest and Mark them. Combine him with the Arbalest(<u>lvl1: 50% DMG vs. Marked</u>), Highwayman(lvl3: 35% DMG vs. Marked but -15% DMG mod), or Grave Robber (lvl 2: 28% DMG vs. Marked but -10% DMG mod; the target should be also blighted to get additional 23% DMG). Grave Robber is a pretty good class, especially in synergy with the Plague Doctor. You can also pair Marked with the Houndmaster's Hound's Rush ability (<u>+90% DMG vs. Marked</u>). However, his abilities to reduce stress (with some probability) and cause bleeding are rather questionable in Ruins.
- Jester. A very good tech class for destroying large mobs or bosses. His Final ability gives him the opportunity to destroy a strong mob or take off a lot of HP from a boss with one hit. He can also relieve the stress of partners and himself with the Inspiring Tune ability. His bleeding skills are not that good in ruins, since Unholy has no skin.
- Antiquarian. I would say it is a weaker version of Plague Doctor. In Ruins, the Blight skill or treatment with resistance to bleed is still useful. However, the class is better used to redirect damage to other survivable classes (Crusader, Man-at-Arms, Hellion, Leper) or dodge classes (Grave Robber, Jester, Houndmaster).
