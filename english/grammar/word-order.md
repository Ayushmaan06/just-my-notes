# Word order

The main factor that determines the position of a word is its **function**. For example, a noun used as the subject of the verb has to go at the beginning of the sentence. A noun used as the object of a verb can only go after the verb. As the placement of words can significantly affect the meaning of a sentence it is important to learn the rules regarding the position of words.

## Position of verbs

**Verbs** usually go immediately after subjects. There are mainly two kinds of verbs: auxiliary verbs and main verbs.

In a three-word verb (e.g. *have been invited*), the first two are auxiliary verbs whereas the third one is the main verb. 

The only type of word that can go between the subject and the verb are adverbs of frequency. Examples are: **usually, often, never, seldom, always** and **occasionally**.

> She **often** visits her friends in Singapore.
> I **usually** get up at 7 am.
> We **sometimes** watch action films.

When the verb consists of three words, the frequency adverb goes after the first.

> I have **never** been inviting to their parties.

### Splitting

We can split infinitives by placing an adverb between `to` and verb.

> I need to quickly write this note.

The consensus among English usage experts is that split infinitives are usually acceptable because it is often necessary to avoid ambiguous, incorrect, and awkward phrasing.

## Position of adjectivesï»¿

Adjectives usually go before the nouns they modify.

> We met an **interesting** man.
> That was a **wonderful** experience.

Note that we cannot put another word between an adjective and the noun it modifies. However, we can use any number of adjectives to modify the same noun.

> She married a **tall**, **dark**, **handsome** man.

Adjectives can also go after **linking verbs**. Note that the most common linking verbs in English are: **is, am, are, was, were, become, seem, appear, taste, feel, grow and turn.** 

When adjectives go after linking verbs, they usually describe the subject.

> I felt **awful**.
