## Common mistakes

- He **hasn't still bought** a computer. **Error**. 

  He **still hasn't bought** a computer. **OK**.

  > Sorry, I don't understand this example. :laughing: **Still** usually comes in ‘mid-position’.
  >
  > Many people on the Internet say that this version is right. OK.
  >
  > It is better to use **yet** in negation and interrogation in present perfect.: "He hasn't bought a computer yet."

  > Also, you can say any of the following:
  >
  > I still haven't read that book.
  > I haven't read that book yet.
  > I still haven't read that book yet. — implies that you have meant to read the book several times but have not done it yet.
  > I have yet to read that book.

  She **still is** abroad. **Error.**
  She **is still** abroad. **OK**

  > We don’t use **still** before the first auxiliary (such as have (has,had), be (am, is, are, was, were), do (does/did)) or modal verb in an affirmative clause.

- I will call you **when I will finish**. **Error**.
  I will call you **when I finish**. **OK**.

  > We use present simple or present perfect after the word *when*.

- Take a map **in case you will get lost**. **Error**.
  Take a map **in case you get lost**. **OK**.

  > We use present simple or present perfect after the word *in case*, *if*, *when*.
  >
  > It feels like in order to remember the right word, you need to think about time clauses (which started with words such as *when*, *whenever*, *as soon as*, etc.) and conditioned (*if*) / precautionary (*in case*) action.
  
  > It is important not to confuse *if* and *in case*. They can be used in similar sentences, but they have different meanings. Consider the following examples:
  >
  > I will take a coat **if** it rains. (true → take a coat, false → nope)
  > I will take a coat **in case** it rains. (precaution — depending on the possibility)
  > Here, *if* is used to present a conditional situation (dependent it raining), while *in case* is a precaution [ru: предосторожность] (done to prepare for the rain).
  >
  > *If*, as a conditional, shows an action or event that is dependent on something else happening. The action will not happen unless the if clause happens.
  >
  > *In case* is usually used to show that an action is being taken, or preparations have been made, as a precaution – so the action or event is completed based on a possibility.
