## Adverbs of frequency

- come before the `main verb` but after the verb `to be`, auxiliary verbs (such as `do`, `have`) or modal verbs.
- they go before the auxiliary verbs in short answers: `Yes, I usually do.`.
- expressions about days go at the beginning or the end of a sentence.
- `never`, `seldom`, `rarely` have a negative meaning and are not used with `not`.

## State verbs

> page 10.

- verbs which express likes / dislikes + **`enjoy`**.
- verbs of senses [ru: чувств, задействование уш, глаз и т.д.]: **`see`**, `hear`, `smell`, **`taste`**, **`look`**, **`feel`**. We often use `can`/`could` with these words at the moment of speaking.
- verbs of perception [ru: восприятие, задействование знаний, процессов мышления]: **`think`**, `know`, `believe`, `remember`, `notice`, `see` (= `understand`), `expect`(= `think`).
- some other verbs: `be`, `contain`, `belong`, `include`, `have` (= `possess`), `keep` (= `continue`).
- some of the above state verbs (bold font) are used in continuous tenses when they describe actions and not states:

> It `looks` as if (as if = like) they've finished the job. (= appears).
Mike `is looking` out of the window. (= is directing his eyes).

- the verb enjoy can be used in cont. tenses to express specific preference:

> I `am enjoying` this party a lot (specific preference).

- the verbs `look` (when we refer to a person's appearance), `feel` (= experience a particular emotion), hurt and ache can be used in in either cont. or simple tenses with no difference in meaning.
