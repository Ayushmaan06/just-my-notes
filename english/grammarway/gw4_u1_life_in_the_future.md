# Life in the future 
I believe that life will be very different in the future. Firstly, scientists are bound to invent food pills which will replace actual meals. Secondly, I expect to see more electric cars than we have now and maybe someday we will get flying cars shown in the Blade Runner movie. 

Nowadays entertainment is changing quickly especially in the form of game industry. For example, we have already got virtual reality helmets, power computers and consoles for gaming. Also cybersport is developing in many different ways.

Many countries have their own spaceship programs. That means that we are on the point of travelling among different planets in the our Solar system. Perhaps, we will build colonie on the Mars. 

We live in the century of the Internet. That's why we can do shopping from the our home. I believe in the future we will receive food, drinks from drones which will deliver the goods to us across the sky.

On the whole, I think that life in the future will be very different from life today, as there will be many more changes which we cannot yet imagine.
