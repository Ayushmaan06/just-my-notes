# Old English

## Old English, Middle English, Modern English

Before exploring the wonderful depths of Shakespeare’s English, it is important to understand what exactly Old, Middle, and Modern English are and when they were/are spoken.

Old English is the earliest recorded form of the English language. It was spoken throughout England as well as in parts of Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It first came to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century. The [first recorded Old English](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/engol) writing comes from the middle of the 7th century.

The Old English period ended after the Norman Conquest of 1066. With the growing influence of Anglo-Norman, the language evolved into what is known today as Middle English.

Here is an example of Old English (of which there were four distinct dialects):

> Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum; Si þin nama gehalgod to becume þin rice gewurþe ðin willa on eorðan swa swa on heofonum.

These are the first lines of [The Lord’s Prayer](https://www.lords-prayer-words.com/lord_traditional_king_james.html) in Old English. With just a glance at the text, it’s obvious how different this English is from the Modern English spoken today and in Shakespeare’s time.

Here is an example of the same passage in Middle English:

> Oure fadir that art in heuenes, halewid be thi name; thi kyndoom come to; be thi wille don in erthe as in heuene.

In the 14th century, after the [Great Vowel Shift](https://www.thoughtco.com/great-vowel-shift-gvs-1690825) (a series of changes in pronunciation), that Early Modern English, or New English, came into being.

Here is how the lines would’ve been written when Early Modern English was first becoming the standard in Shakespeare’s time:

> Our father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done, in earth, as it is in heauen.

This is very different to Old or Middle English, but not too different to today’s English, right?

## Early Modern English as Shakespeare’s English

The Early Modern English language was around 100 years old when Shakespeare was writing his plays. All major documents were still written in Latin, and over the course of his lifetime, [Shakespeare contributed approximately 1,700 to 3,000 words to the English language](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/resources/words-shakespeare-invented/).

Shakespeare had an immense vocabulary that stretches to four times that of the average well-educated man by some records. His version of English was spoken and written until around 1690, when it shifted into what is fully recognizable today as Modern English.

Take a look at this famous passage of Shakespeare’s language from [*Romeo and Juliet*](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/romeo-juliet-play/):

> If I profane with my unworthiest hand
> This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
> My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
> To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

In these lines, [Romeo Montague](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/romeo-montague/) is talking to [Juliet Capulet](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/juliet-capulet/), professing his desire to kiss her while at the same time comparing his lips, through a metaphor, to “pilgrims.”

Shakespeare’s use of language goes beyond simple storytelling. His works have endured because of the creative, never before seen ways that be combined words and used figurative language. Take a look at Juliet’s response:

> Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
> Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
> For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
> And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.

[Shakespeare uses puns](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/blog/shakespeare-puns/), similes, [metaphors](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/blog/shakespeare-metaphors/), and [allusions](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/literature/allusion/) all within this section of the play. It is one of three sonnets embedded in *Romeo and Juliet* and is one that is most evocative. He manages to convey Romeo’s interest, his concern that his advances are too forward as well as Juliet’s innocent, and yet flirtatious, perceptive.

Here is one more quote from the play, from [Act III Scene 2:](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/plays/modern-romeo-juliet/act-3-scene-2/)

> O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!
> Did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave?
> Beautiful tyrant, feind angelical, dove feather raven, wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of devinest show, just opposite to what thou justly seemest – A dammed saint, an honourable villain!

Juliet speaks these lines as a reaction to the news that Romeo killed her [cousin Tybalt](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/tybalt-romeo-juliet/). She’s at once outraged and confused. Shakespeare uses oxymorons when Juliet calls Romeo a “feind angelical” (fiendish angel) and a “Beautiful tyrant.” He’s shown a side of himself that surprised her. In conclusion, Juliet marvels that his body, which she calls a “gorgeous palace,” could hold “deceit” or evil.

This is one of the best short passages to read when considering how Shakespeare used language. It shows the similarities and differences in Early Modern English and Modern English that is spoken today. At the same time, it also shows his skill with language, something that can’t ever be overstated.

### Prose and Verse in Shakespeare’s Plays

The previous passage is an example of prose dialogue, something that Shakespeare’s characters often speak in. There is no rhyme or meter in the lines.

There are moments in which Shakespeare shifts into verse to write dialogue though. This is usually when a member of the upper class, or a noble, is talking. He uses blank verse or unrhymed [iambic pentameter](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/sonnets/iambic-pentameter/). This refers to the number of beats per line and the arrangement of the stresses. An iamb is one metrical foot. It contains two beats, the first of which is unstressed and the second stressed. When a line is in iambic pentameter, it contains five of these metrical feet.

Sometimes Shakespeare would use another technique, known as [syncope](https://poemanalysis.com/glossary/syncope/), to remove vowels and change the pronunciation of words to fit in the pattern. For example, these lines from [*A Midsummer Nights’ Dream*](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/midsummer-nights-dream-play/), spoken by [Oberon](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/oberon-midsummer-nights-dream/):

> Fetch me that flow’r; the herb I showed thee once:

In these lines, the word “flower” is pronounced with a single syllable.

Rarely, Shakespeare used something known as trochaic verse. This metrical pattern appears in “magical” passages, such as in Macbeth when the [three witches](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/characters/three-witches-macbeth/) transition into trochaic tetrameter for these famous lines:

> Double, double toil and trouble,
> Fire burn, and cauldron bubble

This helps emphasize their otherworldliness, the fact that these women are quite different from any of the other characters in the play.

### Original pronunciation of Shakespeare’s language

There’s another angle to explore when considering Shakespeare’s language, and that is pronunciation.

These days when we see Shakespeare performed it tends to be full of weight and reverence – posh, and as fancy as the Queen. But there is another school of thought called [“original pronunciation” (also known as “OP” or “Shakespeare’s pronunciation”)](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/blog/shakespeares-original-pronunciation/). This is the concept of understanding, performing or listening to Shakespeare’s works (and language) as they would have been spoken during Shakespeare’s time.

### Quora

> Why are Shakespeare's works so difficult to understand?

To echo what everyone else has already said, Shakespeare peppers his writing with mentions contemporary political figures, societal conflicts, London topography, and social mores that make no sense to most of us. A complete understanding of his work requires background knowledge of everything Shakespeare read in school as well as the political climate of whatever particular year in which he was writing. Half the time when people cut Shakespeare it's because he's gone on a tangent about the fact that women wearing makeup was a recent development in English fashion (his thoughts on it can be summed up by “take her swimming on the first date”) or why conscripting soldiers to go fight in Ireland is a bad idea.

In addition, he makes a lot of references to the classics, which he and his peers would have read as children but most of us in the 21st century don't know a lot about, and relies on suppositions about how the world works that we in the 21st century know aren't true, like the fact that pelicans don't actually feed their young by secreting blood from their beaks.

Although I'm always in favor of reading or seeing Shakespeare in a form as close to the original as you feel comfortable, I think it's more important to read or see it in whatever way is easiest for you to understand, because Shakespeare is beautiful and meaningful and sometimes it's easy to miss that if you're busy sorting through a bunch of words that haven't been relevant to anyone in the last three hundred years. When you cut out that stuff, the differences in language actually aren't that much of a barrier.

To quote the contemporary (and perhaps equally incomprehensible) playwright Ben Johnson,

*“I remember, the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare that in his writing (whatsoever he penned)* **he never blotted out line. My answer hath been, would he had blotted a thousand.** *[…] And to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor his memory (on this side idolatry) as much as any; he was (indeed) honest, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions; wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped.”*

---

I always loved the part in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World where people start to LAUGH about the rampant sexual jealously in Shakespeare revealed to them by John the Savage since these mores are so alien to their own totally promiscuous society. Cultural context can either confound understanding or be taken as a challenge when one reads Shakespeare.

In addition to the factors already identified by others, Shakespeare also used metaphors from folklore and the natural world quite frequently. These would have been well understood in his time, but may not be in ours. Too bad, because enigmatic statements like, "I have drunk, and seen the spider" (The Winter's Tale) are quite evocative. (Spiders were thought to hide themselves in cups and secrete poisons that remained under the surface of the drinks, which is a PERFECT metaphor for heinous plots and horrible knowledge in the human realm). Indeed, some of this now obscure imagery might help us to unravel the main points of the plays and make us appreciate them all the more.

Shakespeare's plots can also be quite violent, and our emotional distress may hinder us from understanding the action. What is palatable enough on the page may not be in live performance. I started to blank out during a new production of Othello just the other day even though I am quite familiar with this play and some of the swords came WAY too close for comfort from the tiny little stage floor.

Revenge once had an elaborate set of social "remedies" such as duels that are no longer legal in Western society. Family feuds like the one seen in Romeo and Juliet were very common, and servants got involved in them just like they do in Shakespeare. The underlying subtleties of these relationships are not always apparent to modern audiences.

Speaking of servants, the "clever/scheming servant" was a major trope in Shakespeare's time since there were many more servants than masters and it wasn't always a match made in heaven. Dress also played a major role in conveying one's occupation and social status. Shakespeare's audiences would have picked up on this through the costumes and been better able to predict certain kinds of conflicts amongst the characters than we are.

A lowly servant in Shakespeare might very well throw off a lot of in-jokes and double entendres that would elude us completely today. The discourse amongst the higher classes tended to be very mannered and people like merchants and soldiers also had their own way of speaking. Shakespeare tried to capture these different registers of language in his plays and it can be both captivating and confusing.

People of Shakespeare's time were immersed in classical and Biblical texts that are no longer universally read. "Fantastic" settings like the one in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" have many characters with antique names like Theseus and Hippolyta. Shakespeare also traveled to many different places like Italy and met many different kinds of people like Shylock the Jew.

In other words, we can't naturally take as many cues from the sociocultural context in which Shakespeare's plays are embedded as the audiences of his own time and might easily miss important subtexts. Shakespeare's literary imagination ranged far and wide, and few modern readers would be able to follow him through each and every new world he created without considerable research. For me the complexity of Shakespearean works is a major part of their charm, but they will never provide pure entertainment.

---

I would say the difficulty is three-fold.

1. They are written in Early Modern English, which is very much like contemporary English but used some different words that often trip up people today, including the use of thee.
2. The topics. There are themes in the sonnets and plays that are unknown to most modern readers unless they have spent time reading about that time or reading essays about his works.
3. Shakespeare used a type of sarcastic wit to make very sober statements (including political and social critique). If people aren’t used to that kind of language, they will miss the purpose of the “jokes.”

> If you can't understand Shakespeare when you read it, are you dumb?

No, not at all! There are lots of different factors that will influence how well you are able to understand Shakespeare when you read it, but it certainly doesn't mean you are dumb! If you have experience of learning and speaking lots of languages, you might be surprised to find that you understand more on a first reading of Shakespeare than others do, as he was widely read and used a great deal of words and vocabulary that were brand new, often derived from or relating to other European and ancient languages.

Another factor that will of course influence how far you are able to understand Shakespeare is whether or not you have read any or seen any before -- you will find that as you become more familiar with his plays similar themes, ideas and word usages will crop up again and again and you will gradually come to understand it better. But remember that Shakespearean English contains many many words and phrases that are no longer in use in modern English so of course there is no reason you could be expected to understand it immediately - you definitely aren't "dumb"!

Here are some tips for understanding Shakespeare:

- Get a really good edition (I would personally recommend the Riverside Shakespeare). This should have a glossary at the bottom of each page where they list by line number all the difficult or archaic words he uses (and whole phrases too sometimes) and explain what they mean. Reading a text with a good glossary is like having an interpreter there with you -- every time you get to a bit you don't understand you just flick your eyes down and hey presto there is a modern translation! But you still feel like you are doing the work and reading the original text which can be very satisfying.
- Try No Fear Shakespeare -- a series of Shakespeare's works "translated" into modern language to make them more accessible; try this if you don't have time to go through the original text using a glossary or if you are still stuck
- Read a synopsis online before you begin. Often in Shakespeare if you knew what was going on it would be easier to work out what the meaning of the text is so having an idea of the storyline before you start reading can be hugely helpful in understanding

---

No. You are not dumb whatsoever.

It is important to keep in mind that Shakespeare wrote to be performed. Much of the meaning, and the enjoyment of the language, comes from a good actor. I was fortunate in that my school when I was in middle school, actually took us to see a live Shakespeare production which helped cement my lifelong love of Shakespeare.

Shakespeare is Modern English not old English but it's usage is both poetic (it isn't meant to sound like regular speech), and from a different time.

Consider that line "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo". Now unless you already know that wherefore (a term not in use today) means "Why" not "Where", it will be difficult to understand what is going on. Juliet is not asking, Hey Romeo Where are You? She is asking: Why is your name Romeo - the reason being that his last name is the name of her family's mortal enemy.

She is really saying: oh why is this person I love from the family I've been brought up to hate.

This is where a teacher should help.

But the language of Shakespeare is amazing and when you hear it performed, you'll better understand the words and their meaning.

However, if you do not understand the original text, I recommend you to try reading an annotated version — there should be plenty available. The best kinds will have the script on one side of the page. But I don't read it in modern English. Shakespeare is not a story-teller, he's a stylist. Some say he's the greatest stylist of English language. So I'm in it for the language.

If you want to try reading the original, here are some methods that worked for me:

- Listen to audio books. Macbeth is a play, it's supposed to be performed. Even if you can't understand some words, you can usually figure out what's going on from actors' intonations and key sentences. Arkangel Shakespeare is dramatized and particularly good. Once you know what's going on, it's easier to read it in detail.
- Read the text that comes with annotations. Lots of words and sentences will be explained in footnotes. Folger Shakespeare even comes with introductions that include helpful pointers on understanding Shakespeare language.
- The more you read Shakespeare in original, the better you'll get at it. You'll start understanding his twisting sentences and you'll unwrap them faster, and you'll start recognizing the words, and you'll recognize when he's having a pun.
- If you don't understand a passage at all, don't look it up in modern English translation. Chances are, the "translators" didn't understand it either and they'll give you an inaccurate version quite confidently, further confusing you. Because it's not a translation from a certain language to a certain other language. It's people trying to figure out what Shakespeare meant.

It's a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end. Let me quote a passage from Macbeth, see if you like it at all:

> "Double, double toil and trouble;
>
> Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
>
> Fillet of a fenny snake,
>
> In the cauldron boil and bake;
>
> Eye of newt and toe of frog,
>
> Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
>
> Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
>
> Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
>
> For a charm of powerful trouble,
>
> Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
>
> Double, double toil and trouble;
>
> Fire burn and cauldron bubble."

You can probably see where the inspiration for Harry Potter potions came from.

Yes. You are dumb.

Or French.

OK - that was (sort of) sarcasm.

The point about the "French" comment is that Elizabeth(I)an English is very, very, different from Elizabeth(II)an English, which is in turn, different from American English (21C), which is different from Australian/New Zealander/Indian/Zimbabwean/insert-nation-of-choice English, let alone French / German / classical Latin / Ecclesiastical Latin / Shona / Lhasa / whatever.

We in England have learned to parse American English differently, and we have learnt to parse the English of millennia past differently. They are, in any meaningful sense of the word, foreign.

Your ability to parse Shakespear / Shakespeare / Shaikspir / he spelled it many way properly is A SKILL.

A SKILL is a type of intelligence.

I have had the privilege to meet, over the last 40 years, a whole bunch of people who have had intelligences that we should rightly regard as "world class':

- In the late 1980s, I played in a music group where the leader was Emma Johnson, the clarinetist who was later awarded an MBE, won the BBC Young Musician of the Year, and then debuted at Carnegie Hall, age 25.
- I had lunch with Tim Howes, inventor of the LDAP protocol, in (about) 2000, when LoudCloud were bidding for the hosting for Europe's 17th largest company for whom I was (at the time) Web Systems Manager.
- From 1989-1992, I was taught Pure Mathematics by Frances Kirwan, lecturer in Maths at Balliol, and the first female Chair of the London Mathematical Society.
- I worked, in the late 1990s, for Sir Frank Lampl, the first East European to be Knighted, and who faced a European Parliament inquiry on Canary Wharf, confounding the translators by answering EVERY SINGLE MEMBER of the panel in their own language.
- In the 2000s, I served as a non-exec for Darryl Mattocks, who had previously been, CEO of Europe's first commercial dot com, and one of the few Brits to earn more than a £million on multiple flotations of startups he'd started.
- My 8-year-old is taught Ballet and Modern dance by Charlie Savident (how she fits in teaching with her pan-European dance shows is a mystery!)


Here's the point (apart from me being unbelievably lucky!) - none of them could have done each others' jobs. None of them were, as far as I know, able to correctly parse the Bard of Avon on first blush.

However, the obvious implication is that ALL OF THEM, while intelligent, world-class intelligent, in some ways, were "dumb" in others.

What's your talent?

If it's understanding Elizabethan English, then great.....

... but if it's not, so what?

---

No, you are not dumb, is the short answer.

But the reasons why many find Shakespeare difficult to read are manifold. However, one of those reasons is *not* the 'old-style' language. Shakespeare's English is, to all intents and purposes, identical to our own. Of course, there are words and phrases that have fallen into disuse, but that it is as true of some novels written fifty years ago as it is of, say, ‘Hamlet’. In fact, his language is remarkable for its use of monosyllables, and its infrequent use of Latinisms.

The only significant vocabulary differences are those of pronouns such as ‘thy’ and ‘thine’. Shakespeare used these, and their more modern counterparts, pretty much interchangeably, but few people, I suspect, deciding to read him, would struggle to understand them.

As has been said, these are words that are meant to spoken aloud, or at the very least, sounded in the head. That requires a slower reading speed.

Perhaps the major reason that makes Shakespeare seem difficult is that he wrote—for the most part--dramatic poetry. Poetry is compressed language. To achieve that compression, poets will often distort syntax (the order of words) from that which would be natural, to that which will achieve the metre (or rhythm) in which they are working. They will also omit much of the connective tissue that links ideas together.

And his poetry is rooted in rhetoric, the art in which he was most fully trained. Rhetorical devices pervade much of his verse, and until one becomes familiar (it happens quickly) with their application, the argument can be difficult to follow.

Well, English-speaking world has been producing Hamlet, as a major play or a film, every three years in average. I've also seen a couple of local productions and a Russian film that some claim is the best Hamlet ever. And they are all different -- at least a handful I've seen. I admire David Tennant as an actor, I cannot stand his understanding of Hamlet.

What it means is that between professional thespians, different people understand it differently. There is no one "understand of Hamlet."

Which is not surprising. Hamlet speaks about parental abuse, sliding into insanity and contemplating/committing suicide, betrayal, marital relationships. Some people are lucky enough not to understand it because it is not about them. Some people don't allow themselves to understand it because it is too close to home.

BTW, it is one of the few cases when I have to disagree with [Marc Bodnick](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Bodnick) -- I cannot be so sure everyone in Shakespearean times could fully understand Shakespeare. It is entirely possible that for the original audience Hamlet was a "who done it" crime story. After all, that is what Dostoevsky was trying to write in a jiffy to pay his debts -- and ended up with "Crime and Punishment."

Let's take the episode when Hamlet refuses to kill praying King: "To take him in the purging of his soul,\When he is fit and season'd for his passage?\No."

The scholarly explanation is that back then people had more by the letter understanding of Christianity, and really believed that a murderer killed while praying would ho to Heaven. I ran an experiment (years ago), and asked a few guys to run the situation with people who didn't know Shakespeare but knew violence -- an ex-soldier (Australian), a full-contact martial artist, etc. They all reacted "it's BS, he just cannot kill" -- all of them. And I bet the people of Elizabethan England had better understanding of violence than vast majority of Europeans and bohemian Americans.

Both interpretations are right, he doesn't give you a clear answer.

BTW, Shakespearean English is much further from English than say Ukrainian or Serbian from Russian, and much-much further than Serbian from Ukrainian. It is a foreign language.

I was a straight A English student who now gets paid money to write, and I had a terrible time with Shakespeare on the page. It's basically reading screenplays in a foreign language, why should anyone think that's easy? The annotations in the editions we were using in high school weren't much help; they presumed you had a solid grounding in history and literature and just needed little nudges. To really get any value out of Shakespeare on the page, you'd need deep immersion in Elizabethan language, and not just the formal stuff, but the slang and dirty jokes. You'd also need a firm grounding in the classical world, which most of us in contemporary America do not have. The ideal solution would be to hyperlink the plays like crazy so you could chase down all the references and vocabulary and so on, with images and sound and video.

I only started enjoying Shakespeare plays when I saw them on their feet, the way they're supposed to be experienced. You can pick up a lot from context when you see people interacting, so it's easier to keep everyone straight and understand the plot. The musicality of the language rings through more clearly too, and you're not so worried about missing a turn of phrase or reference here and there. I got way more out of Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet and Roman Polanski's Macbeth than I did from the texts. And I only really started feeling the emotion of Hamlet from playing guitar in a couple of different productions of Hair. There are several quotes sprinkled into the songs -- "I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth" and so on, and it's pretty powerful when you hear them sung a thousand times.

---

Of course not.

I think half the problem is that so many people fake their way through Shakespeare and try to pretend they understand it better than they actually do. Thus, you may feel stupid if you compare yourself to other people who may be faking anyway.

I just took a class on Shakespeare, just for personal enjoyment, and I found that what was absolutely critical was that I understood the background of the play, the characters, and their relationships first. For a history like Henry IV, Part 1, if you don't understand who all the Henrys are and their relationships to each other, who owes whom a favor, and who expects payback, you'll be lost. You can find a lot of information online, but even better than that is talking to a good teacher.

Second, get a good edition with clear footnotes. A lot of the language is archaic, and many of the words either are not used at all anymore or are used completely differently. The footnotes will clarify a lot. Last, Shakespeare wrote plays, not novels. Read the plays out loud, or better yet, get some friends or classmates together and act them out. Or watch a movie version (turn the subtitles on; it helps to hear and read the words at the same time).

---

[Marc ](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Bodnick)says it plainly - the change in language (and idiom, especially) is hard for people to parse when they read it.

But consider, too, that Shakespeare's plays were never meant to be *read*; they were meant to be performed.

One of the most eye-opening experiences of my school life was the Franco Zeffirelli version of *Romeo and Juliet*. It was...oh my god, I knew these people! The girl sitting next to me was Juliet and her boyfriend...totally Romeo. They were in LOVE, and no one understood them. They were always plotting to run away and get married or die together. I was Mercutio, of course, talking about things no one understood and being driven mad by their drivel about love.

It didn't matter that I didn't follow every single word, watching it being performed made all the difference in the world. I suddenly realized that I understood everything in that play - the obscure phrasing and rhythm was no longer a barrier to understanding, it was music being sung by actors telling a story I knew well.

If you can't understand Shakespeare when you read it, try watching a performance. Don't pick something like *Coriolanus*, pick an easy one, that has been rethunk, reformulated, reworked a million times. When you see it come to life, it will make all the difference in the world to what Shakespeare means to you.

Coda: Don't pick *Macbeth*. It is the best play he wrote and has been beaten to death by every single performance of it ever. It's so good, no one can do it right.

### So, why is it so difficult reading Shakespeare's language?

There are a few basic facts about language that will help in reading Shakespeare's language. 

1. Number one: **any living, spoken language changes over the course of time**. Two fundamental ways in which language changes are **phonologically** (they way words are pronounced) and **semantically** (what words mean). We can see how some words have changed in their pronunciation by looking at some of Shakespeare's rhymes: food/good and mood/ blood. We can look at differences in American dialects to see how words are pronounced differently by various speech communities. For example, for some people the "s" in "greasy" has a soft "c" sound, but for others the "s" is a voiced "z." 
   However, it is in Shakespeare's use of words that no longer have the same meaning that causes the real trouble. For example, in Act III of "Hamlet" when Ophelia tells Hamlet, "You are naught, you are naught," she means more than what one would say to a misbehaving child. The word "naught" or "naughty" in Shakespeare's day meant "wicked." Ophelia's response to Hamlet's sexual innuendo now makes sense. Again, we can look to our own times for examples of words that have changed their meanings. For example, the word "bad" has lost its original negative meaning (in some contexts) to mean something quite the opposite.
2. **Sometimes words simply disappear**. Shakespeare's language made frequent use of "thou," "thee," and "ye." These three words were all forms of the one word we use today: you. Why did Shakespeare use these words and what happened to them? 
   - "Thou" was the nominative case pronoun, meaning that it was used as the subject of a sentence, as in "Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!"
   - The pronoun "thee" was the objective case form used as the object of verbs and prepositions, as in "Get thee to a nunnery," or "I'll give thee this plague ... ."
   - The pronoun "ye" was simply the plural form of "you." These three pronouns eventually were all replaced by the pronoun "you." They simply went away. We still see attempts by some dialects of American English to preserve a distinction between the plural "ye" and singular "you." Many speakers of American English use words and constructions such as you-all, y'all, youse, youse guys, and you-uns to denote the plural "you."

3. Apart from changes in pronunciation, meaning, and the loss of some words entirely, Shakespeare's language is denoted by his use of **inverted syntax**, or, simply, **the way he puts his sentences together**. The normal word order in a modern English sentence is subject - verb - complement. Shakespeare frequently inverts that order for stylistic reasons, including maintaining meter, creating rhyme, or creating interest by varying his structure. For example, Horatio responds to Marcellus' demand for information with "That can I." A modern reader should have no trouble quickly converting Horatio's response to "I can" without missing a beat of the original. Inverting syntax is a common feature of good writing in our own times, creating interest, variety, and emphasis when needed.
