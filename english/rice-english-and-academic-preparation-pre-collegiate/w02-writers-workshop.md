**Thesis statements**

TS:

- describes your position or opinion on a particular statement. 

- is generally NOT a list of facts, a summary, or a question.
- is specific enough to give the writer and reader some idea as to the direction the writing will take. Shouldn't be vague (нечіткими).
- can change over time as you work on your essay  

When writing the TS you should answer:

- What's your point?

  > Reg exercise is crucial to maintain a healthy lifestyle...

- Why should I care?

  > ... because it helps manage  an ideal weight, prevents disease, and can increase energy levels.

In academic writing, the thesis is usually found near the beginning of  an essay. You’ve probably been told that it should go at the end of the  first paragraph. This is a pretty good place for a thesis statement, but just be aware that this isn’t always the location in which you’ll find it.

**Topic sentences & supporting details**
Topic Sentences:

- TS guides a structure of an entire essay, a topic sentence **guides the structure of an individual paragraph**

- are usually the first or second sentence in a paragraph  

- communicate the main idea of the paragraph to the reader  

Top. sen: first 2 sentences of the paragraph

Topic sentence need the support of approp. chosen supporting details to succ. communicate your ideas.

Supporting Details:

- give the reader more information about the paragraph's topic  

- must give appropriate support to the topic sentence  

- can explain, give an example, show cause and effect, and more  

Ex. of topic sentences

- too broad = "Studying is difficult"

- better = "Studying for university science courses is often difficult for students"

  > inc. spec group of people (students) and a spec. object (science courses)

Ex.

- too narrow = "The US shares a border with Canada and Mexico"

- better = "The United States shared borders with Mexico and Canada helped improve the economies of all three countries."

  > we can expand the last one into a full paragraph with supporting details.

Ex. of supporting details

"Canada plans to welcome approximately 330,000 new permanent residents in 2019."

**Plagiarism**
There are three main strategies you can use to prevent plagiarism.

1. Always turn in original work.
2. Cite your sources (don't forget quotation marks if you just copy)
3. Paraphrase

A Good Paraphrase:

- uses synonyms.  
- changes word forms (i.e. change a noun to a verb)
- changes quoted speech to indirect speech (or vice versa)  
- re-arranges the grammatical structure of the sentence  
- finds alternative ways to restate numbers or percentages  
- changes active voice to passive voice (or vice versa)  

**Citations**

1. APA citation style is used in social science classes.
2. MLA citation style is used in humanities classes.
3. In-text citations occur inside a piece of writing.  
4. End-of-text citations are longer and are found at the end of an essay on a works cited page.  
5. Correctly citing sources helps you avoid plagiarism.
