>
> - children are susceptible to v. g. b/c their mind is growing.

## Connecting ideas

There are three types of connectors:

- transition words and phrases (also known as introductory words/phrases)
  - beginning of a sentence. When speaking, give a short pause after the transition. When writing, follow the transition with as comma. 
  - ex. of contrast: However, Despite [noun or pronoun], (Despite their popularity,) In contrast, On the contrary, On the other hand.
  - ex. of adding on information: Furthermore, In addition, Moreover.
  - ex. of introducing an example: For example, For instance, To illustrate.
  - ex. of introd. an effect or consequence:  Consequently, Therefore, Thus.
- coordinating conjunctions (координаційні сполучники)
  - in between two clauses. When speaking, use a ^ rising intonation at the end of the first clause (before "but") and give a !small emphasis to "but." When writing, precede the coordinator with a comma.
  - ex.: but, yet (to show a contrast too), and (+ info), so (-> effect or conseq.).
- subordinating conjunctions (підрядні сполучники)
  - connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, come at the beg. or mid. of a sentence. When speaking, use a rising intonation at the end of the first clause and a falling intonation at the end of the sentence. When writing, put a comma after the clause when you use the subordinator (підрядний) in the beginning of a sentence. When the subordinator appears in the middle of a sentence, do not use a comma.
  - ex. contrast or unexp. idea: even though, although, though, while.
  - ex. of show. a reason: because since.
  - ex. of show. time: when, while, after, before.
  - ex. of show. a condition: if
