## Patreons to support open source projects? Please share

569 (2017): I've recently gone all in on Linux and I'm cancelling my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, packing up my Affinity software, and putting away my Mac and Windows based video editors, game dev & web dev tools.

Now I want to take the money I was putting into software for these platforms and put it towards supporting great Linux / open source projects instead.

Patreon is ideal for me, rather than one off donations, because I can setup an ongoing contribution to help support ongoing development.

What Patreons do you know of that support excellent work in the Linux community?

There is currently a thread on a Patreon to support one of the main maintainers of GIMP, and in that thread people have shared some other campaigns, thus so far I have....

EDIT - Recompiling the list, this is awesome! I'll keep updating it as long as extras get added in comments. Hopefully this can become a bit of a resource for others looking to go "support shopping".
