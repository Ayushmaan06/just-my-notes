It contains notes on communities, people, software and other projects that I have to support with money. These people do a lot of good things for this world and they deserve any kind of reward, and since our world, as well as our motivation, so much depends on money, then support should be done in this way.

## Dependencies

I made a decision to add this paragraph to track files whose topics overlap with each other on specific subtopics. This will improve knowledge of these specific subtopics.

###### Algorithms and Java
