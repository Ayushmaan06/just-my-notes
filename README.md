## Dependencies

I made a decision to add this paragraph to track files whose topics overlap with each other on specific subtopics. This will improve knowledge of these specific subtopics.

###### Algorithms and Java

There is also a Q/A regarding the `Collections.shuffle()` method.

###### Apps Script and JavaScript

## Marks

`!`, `_` symbols allow quick access to folders with general information when using file managers or Linux terminal. `!` means directory with general information which isn't a part of the main topic (current folder). `_` means directory with specific information which isn't a part of the main topic (current folder).
