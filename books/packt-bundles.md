# Data Science Bundle

Mastering Spark for Data Science - ok

- variety of algorithms and the pure fun, elegance of working with Spark and Scala code ...

> Python Data Science Essentials - bad  
>
> - scikit-learn manual w/t explanations when to use

> Data Science Algorithms in a Week - bad  
>
> - shallow & sloppily written, author jumps from Python to R, attempt to approximate the gradient descent algorithm used in R's linear regression is wrong and shows the author is too lazy to research

# Machine Learning & Big Data Bundle

Engineering MLOps - good?

-  Would recommend this book over online courses!
-  Great book to understand various moving parts in ML life cycle
-  Good Introduction to MLOps 

Mastering Reinforcement Learning with Python - good?

- Great Flow
- nicely written, itâ€™s a very good reference book for beginners and experienced engineers.
- Reference Material, and starter code for Ray rllib

Data Engineering with Python - mediocre

- bad editing, typos
- A Good conceptual foundation, some examples don't work

Serverless Analytics with Amazon Athena - good

- a good book for intro and deep dive into AWS serverless analytics
- Serverless Analytics for Data people
- A detailed and in depth study of Amazon Athena and analytics
- One of the best books to learn about Athena 

## Deep Learning with Python

> Hands-On Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 - bad  

- excellent examples
- rushed, code errors, bad explanations, you will read TensorFlow tutorial in any case
- I had to go to the official tensorflow pages to sort out the code

> TensorFlow Deep Learning Projects - mediocre
>
> - The book assumes a moderately high level of understanding of TensorFlow. Do not buy this book unless you already have a strong understanding of terms like "dropout", "flattenizer", "softmax", and "leaky ReLU activation". Target audience?


> Deep Learning By Example - mediocre?  
>
> - bad typesetting, the references are unscientific, the author describes how a certain DNN can be implemented in Tensorflow, but he does not explain how this DNN (in particular the hyperparameters) was obtained. I was hoping to learn by example how to find a good architecture and optimise the parameters, which is the hard part of deep learning.
> - The book is good for both researchers/lectures and engineers. This book has a very large coverage of content and knowledge. It covers the Data Modeling, Feature Engineering and Model Complexity, currently popular DL toolkit TensorFlow with examples, and different kinds of Neural Nets such as Feed-forward NN/CNN/GAN with some application introduction like classification task, sentiment analysis and face generation. It also introduces transfer learning and representation learning.

> Python Deep Learning Projects - mediocre?  
>
> - Not great for the price and has some issues. Might be better with online tutorials.
> - Great book for all levels
