# Best comics to read

## Zero answer

I'm not a fan of this sentiment at all, I don't think anyone gets to decide what makes someone a "true" fan of something and I especially wouldn't say someone wasn't a true fan for not having read books like Age of Ultron and Civil War, highly flawed as they are.

That aside, my favorites that I recommend to everybody:

- *Saga of the Swamp Thing* by Alan Moore & Steve Bisette
- **Planetary** by Warren Ellis & John Cassaday
- Chew by John Layman & Rob Guillory
- Bone by Jeff Smith
- Stray Bullets by David Lapham

## First answer

There can’t really be a MUST read list, because comics appeal to many different audiences for many different reasons.

The best examples of the medium to me are:

1. **Watchmen** is the best example of the possibilities of the medium.
2. *Maus* is memoir and metaphor done to perfection.
3. From Hell is literature.
4. **The Dark Knight Returns** is cinema done as a comic, blending perfect imagery to story. 
5. *Daredevil Born Again* is the greatest exploration of who a character is ever executed.

Someone:

> I like this answer because it recognizes that "true comic book fan" should probably include the entire medium and not just one (dominant) genre/region.

## Second answer

I can say, Civil War and Age of Ultron, would not be on many lists.

But top 5 I would recommend:

1. A Contract With God
2. **Sandman**
3. Astro City
4. Little Nemo
5. Calvin and Hobbes

## Third answer

**STANDALONE STORIES**

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Kingdom Come**
3. Infinity Gauntlet
4. **The Dark Knight Returns**
5. Kraven's Last Hunt

**COMPLETE RUNS**

1. *Daredevil* by Frank Miller
2. *Green Lantern* by Geoff Johns
3. *Swamp Thing* by Alan Moore
4. Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman
5. Ultimate Spider-Man (Peter Parker) by Brian Michael Bendis

**CURRENT BOOKS**

1. Immortal Hulk by Al Ewing
2. Venom by Donny Cates
3. The Green Lantern by Grant Morrison
4. Your Choice of Amazing Spider-Man by Nick Spencer or Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man by Tom Taylor
5. [reserve spot for Jonathan Hickman's House of X and Powers of X and whatever X-Men stuff of his comes next]

## Fourth answer (various answers)

2: **Watchmen**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, The Dark Phoenix Saga, **Kingdom Come**, and Kraven’s Last Hunt.

2: Preacher, Batman: Killing Joke, Spider Man: Maximum Carnage, Batman: The Man Who Laughs, XMen: Days of Future Past.

2: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, *Judge Dredd: America*, **The Dark Knight Returns**.

> Judge Dredd america is amazing. Judge Dredd year one is some decent fun.
>
> The problem with cherrypicking Dredd is that the later, longer storylines (that is, the multi-part stories, as *Judge Dredd* is published in serial instalments of eight-or so pages in *2000AD* weekly) are grounded in the world gradually introduced in the earlier self-contained strips. One naturally precedes the other. You could just jump into the *Robot Wars* or *The Cursed Earth* and read them, but while they don't rely on the details of Dredd and his world offered previously, they are augmented by it.
>
> Later stories, such as the classic *America* and *Democracy Now!*, work better by being read in their context - that is, Dredd starting as a sci-fi satire on the Dirty Harry-style antihero, then becoming a popular character for its own sake, and then the writers realizing the need to remind the readers that Dredd, and the entire Judge system, is fascist. That gradual drip-feed of information, text and subtext, is what makes Dredd a truly satisfying epic, forty years old and still going strong.
>
> America is a good introduction, other than the Case Files. It is fantastic. Of course, I may be somewhat biased because that is the only Dredd I have read. However as Hugo said (two big paragraphs above), from what I've heard Dredd, it is best to read most stuff in order.

## Fifth answer

In no particular order:

- Scott Pilgrim (Brian Lee O’Malley)
- The Vision (Tom King, Gabriel Walta, & Jordie Bellaire)
- Black Hole (Charles Burns) # really hard
- **Watchmen** (Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons)
- **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman & Everyone)
- Bone (Jeff Smith)
- Blankets (Craig Thompson)
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Bagley, Stuart Immonen, David LaFuente, & Sara Pichelli)
- Astonishing X-Men (Joss Whedon & John Cassaday)
- Batman: The Long Halloween (Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale)
  "+" in other answer: **Kingdom Come** - Even if you don't regularly read their comics, you will know a lot of characters and the art is fantastic.

## Sixth answer

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Sandman**
3. **Planetary**
4. Saga
5. Marvels
6. **Kingdom Come**
7. DC: The new frontier
8. Gotham Central
9. Superior foes of Spider-Man
10. Morrison's Animal man

> Where do you suggest to start with marvel? - By Marvels, I assume he means the (excellent) series by Kurt Busiek and and Alex Ross, not the entire Marvel Universe. That would be a tad excessive as a recommendation.

## Seventh answer

James Robinson - *Starman*

Alan Moore - *Saga of the Swamp Thing* # one guy mentioned this in the top and get many votes

Neil Gaiman - **Sandman**

Mark Waid - **Kingdom Come**

Jeff Smith - Bone

Warren Ellis - **Planetary** # there were many mentions on Reddit

Dave Sim - Cerebus (up to about issue 150 - there's good stuff after that but only the first half is *essential*)

Brian Michael Bendis - Ultimate Spider-Man

David Lapham - Stray Bullets

John Layman - Chew

> Fuck, I forgot Starman! I have to change my list, shit. Good call.

## Eights answer

1. All-Star Superman : This is a story that can make even the biggest Superman detractors fall in love with the guy. This is the quintessential Superhero story.
2. **Kingdom Come** : This is an epic. Alex Ross' art gives it the same feel, and it almost feels like mythology. It's amazing.
3. Final crisis : The best of all the crisis, Morrison does something so amazing that I can't even decipher it in a single read. It's the ultimate story, and it reflects why Superman is the greatest superhero.
4. Infinite Crisis : Another Crisis. This shows that we don't need darkness to create good stories. Stories don't need to be dark and edgy for the sake of it. You know what's better than one Superman? Two of them.
5. Geoff Johns' Green Lantern : This man brought the GL franchise from zero. He built on the legacy that was left by his previous writers and left it at a level that I don't think any other human can. Such innovation, and so many incredible ideas.

## Bonus answer - Essential Graphic Novels Everyone Should Read

1. *Maus* Complete. (Includes Maus + Maus II)

2. The Contract With God Trilogy

3. Sin City: The Hard Goodbye

4. **The Watchmen**

5. Persepolis

6. The Black Hole

7. Kabuki: Circle Of Blood

8. Ghost In The Shell

9. The Killer

10. Blacksad

    "+" **The Sandman**.

## Best Batman comics to read

> [Batman - essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/essentials) on Reddit.

### First answer: three top answers

21: If you like a dark story with a twist, try **The Long Halloween** and its sequel, **Dark Victory**.

11: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory** (sequel to TLH), Hush, Under The Red Hood, Black Mirror, and **The Court of Owls**.

> Someone: I really enjoyed Zero Year as a starting point. Year One is a different comics.

8: The right answer is always **The Court of Owls** (The New 52) for new readers. It's the perfect starting point.

> Court of Owls is pretty dark IMO. # analyzing the comments, I can tell you that's not exactly true.

### Second answer

For a starter I would say read Batman **Year One** or the **Killing Joke**. Basically the greats. After that it's pretty much a pick your own buffet. My personal favorites are no mans land (Batman helping Gotham in a huge earthquake) , **The Court of Owls** (new villians. As namesake) , the world's finest (Batman and Superman team up, its nothing like the movies )

Edit: there was one comic or short that was damn good, it was about Batman's psyche and it ended with Batman in a sewer who could not let go of his guns.

I really recommend you to read it if anyone can help identify it.

### Third answer: three bottom answers

6: Have a go at grant Morrison’s Arkham asylum and Alan Moore’s the killing joke. Both dark, and the art ok Arkham asylum is awesome.

> Edit: killing joke not man who laughs.

5: Must reads are **Killing Joke** by Alan Moore and Hush by Jeph Loeb, both are extremely dark and the best batman books to date in my opinion. If you don't mind a Dick Grayson Batman, try Black Mirror as well, it is extremely dark.

4: **The Dark Knight Returns** is about a Batman who come out of retirement because Gotham’s gone to hell. He’s unleashed, uncappable of holding back. It’s absolutely amazing. Skip watching the animated movies until you’ve read the comic. It’s only four issues.

### Fourth answer: three additional answers

7: **The Court of Owls** is where I would start. It's modern and one of the best Batman stories ever. It's volume 1 of Scoot Snyder's Batman. If you like it, it runs for like 8 volumes.

You are going to get a lot of recommendations for **Year One** and **The Dark Knight Returns**. They are considered Batman classics, but IMO they don't hold up extremely well.

**The Long Halloween** is another one you can jump into without much knowledge of Batman. It's sequel is **Dark Victory**.

3: All New 52. **Killing Joke**. **Year One**. **The Dark Knight Returns**. Batman: The White Knight. Batman Hush. Batman The Black Mirror. Batman Death in the Family. Batman Under the Hood

2: **Batman Year One**. **The dark knight returns** **The long Halloween** **The killing joke** **Dark Victory** Grant Morrison’s Batman run Scott Snyder’s Batman Run

> EDIT: also Batman Earth One by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank.

## Best Comics about the Joker?

### First answer

*Comics:*

- **The Man Who Laughs**
- **The Killing Joke** (seems to be the most relevant to what the upcoming Joker film is going for)

(I haven’t read ”Death in the Family” yet, so I didn’t list it, but I heard it’s a classic. I also heard “**Death *of* the Family**” is very good, and there’s a DC Essential Edition of it coming up)

There’s also “The Three Jokers” coming up by Geoff Johns.

*Films:*

- Batman (1989)
- The Dark Knight (2008)
- Under the Red Hood (an animated film that revolves around the aftermath of “Death in the Family”)

*Video Games:*

- The Arkham Trilogy (even in Knight, the Joker plays a big role).

> Someone: 
>
> Joker by Azzarello is good.
>
> Death of the Family by Snyder and Capullo is probably my favorite.
>
> The last one is collected into a single volume that makes it easier to read for a guy who's not big into comics, as you said.

### Second answer

I loved Batman: White Knight personally - definitely recommend you read it. You may also like some of the New 52 stuff (**Death of The Family** is the one you hear most often but chronologically I'm not sure where it's placed).

> The New 52 is Death **of** the Family, which I agree is really good. A Death **in** the Family is the post-crisis story, that I find terrible. Just wanted to clear it up for OP.

### Third answer - answers on What is your favorite joker story?

You should probably add '*besides the Killing Joke*' because well obviously.

> Then the obvious answer would be "The Laughing Fish".

Endgame.

If I were to choose something besides **The Killing Joke** or "The Laughing Fish", it would be "Dreadful Birthday, Dear Joker".

After **The Killing Joke**, **The Man Who Laughs**.

### Fourth answer - What is the DARKEST Joker story in the Batman comics?

20: If you don't think the Joker from Snyder and Capullo's New 52 run is dark and twisted enough, then I don't know what's wrong with you. That's the most sadistic version I've seen yet.

> Death of the Family and Endgame from New 52 focus on Joker, and they're both great.

> The entire Snyder New 52 run of Batman is fantastic.

20: **Death of the Family**, Endgame, **The Killing Joke**, Brian Azzarello's Joker, **The Man Who Laughs**.

8: Obvious answer is **The Killing Joke** but I think Brian Azzarello's 'Joker' graphic novel is even more unsettling, especially the scene with Frost's ex-wife.

> Joker by Brian Azzerello is fantastic.

### Fifth answer - amazing answer to Joker Comic Reading List

My number 1 personal recommendation is **The Killing Joke** its widely considered to be one of the best joker stories out there and in my opinion is the best. It was the first comic book I read and what hooked me on the character so I may be biased in this regard but I really can't think of a better jumping off point for a new comic book reader in general or a new batman reader or just a new reader to the Joker. Writer Alan Moore gives a gripping and terrifying story focusing more on the Joker then Batman while also exploring one of the possible origin stories for the character all in all it's one of the best characterizations out there along with Brian Bollands beautiful artwork it becomes a must-read for Joker fans.( just make sure to get the deluxe edition which was published years later and includes updated coloring that improves the quality of the whole book even more most comic book shops will exclusively sell the deluxe edition so it shouldn't be a problem but just in case I should mention it if you're not experience with comics)

Next down from that is **Death Of The Family** ( not to be confused with death in the family which is the story of how Jason Todd the second Robin was murdered by the Joker it's an iconic story and undoubtedly an important event in Batman mythos however I personally am not fond of the overall storyline finding it a bit sloppy but feel free to check it out for yourself at your local library or read couple panels at a bookstore and decide) admittedly the new 52 provided a lot of controversial storylines that divided the fan base, however Scott Snyder set out to write a horror story set in the universe of Batman and did so expertly by putting him up against the Joker with the stakes higher than they've ever been. In the start of the new 52 the Joker vanished from Arkham Asylum leaving his face sliced off and nail to wall this story picks up one year later where the Joker is back and has stolen his face back to wear like a mask. Somewhere in the demented brain of his he has come to the conclusion that all of Batman's allies are wearing him down and preventing him from being the best superhero he can be so he decided the only logical conclusion is to take them out one by one this is a massive crossover event between multiple comics that when collected together is genuinely chilling and provides an excellent cross section of the jokers personality as well as giving an excellent look into the relationship between Batman and the Joker. Along with that Greg Capullos art renders the whole thing beautifully horrifying( side note since this is a crossover between multiple publications what you don't want to do is buy a trade paperback of one and wound up with a fifth of the story. On the cover it should say the name of the publication along with the title. Ie. Catwoman- Death of the family. Most comic book shops if you say that you want the entire collected storyline they will be able to provide you with it just in case I bought my copy of Barnes and Noble and to be recognizable this edition has a cover printed with Joker- death of the family. As the title.)

Next isn't really Joker story per se however it does feature the Joker and is a very memorable storyline **The Dark Knight Returns** by Frank Miller is regarded in the comic book world as being one of the greatest comic books ever written as it brought Batman back to his dark roots. In this story it takes place 10 years in the future where Batman is 60 years old and retired however he comes out of retirement to save Gotham City along the way his coming out of retirement will awaken several supervillains have lain dormant including the Joker who returns to have a little fun and put a stop to batman and also super man who is working for the government who comes to odds with Batman in the climax of the story. Again while not featuring The Joker as the prominent focus of the story it does give an excellent cross-section into Batman's personality and one cannot truly understand one without the other. In addition this is going to be the inspiration for the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie will draw from prominently. (Disclaimer the art style of Frank Miller is somewhat of an acquired taste and is perhaps not the best first impression for inexperienced readers.)

one I can think of right now is **Endgame** which also written by Snyder with the same art as the the death of the family is the follow up to the death of the family signaling the return of the Joker after those events and exploring yet another possible origins for him however keeping in history with the Joker they never actually give a concrete yes or no as to what his origin story is always keeping a moving target admittedly I have not read the story myself however I have heard that it is entertaining for my local comic book store and will undoubtedly give it a read ( side note I would not recommend this starting off not only because of the fact that it is a follow up to a different book but also the controversial nature of the story which divided the fan base yet again read a couple other of these stories and come back to this one after you've read and liked DOTF)

Simply titled **Joker** by Brian Azzarello tell the story of the Joker being released from prison and his ride back to power with Gotham's underworld told from the point of view of one of his goons Johnny frost. This story in particular is unique because it never actually shows Batman. It does however show the brutal nature of the Joker and his unstable personality from the outsiders pov giving readers a look in. Because this story is set outside of ordinary continuity the writers were free to explore the character in a new way. The unique art style is done less like a comic drawing and more like oil paintings showcasing several iconic Batman villains. If you enjoyed Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character in The Dark Knight this one is definitely for you as he drew heavily from this graphic novel as inspiration from everything to his general appearance to the way in which the character interacts with the supporting characters.

Lastly is "**The Man Who Laughs** written as a follow up to a year one which was the origin story of Batman this story is essentially a retelling of a classic story from 1940 the one in which Batman first comes to head with the Joker. Now I personally like this story purely because of its principal taking a story that nobody will realistically get to read unless they come for 75 years of comics updating the art style to a more modern setting and sending it back out I really can't say anymore about this book but if you're looking for a good Joker story this is definitely one to check out.

Side note please keep in mind that this is a character with a 75 year lineage and that his character has been told many times by many different authors so there are hundreds of storylines graphic novels and trade paperbacks that feature him as the main character that I am probably leaving out these are only the ones that I have read and enjoyed this being my favorite character. So I encourage you if there's a comic book store near you to go and just check out the rack of Joker comics there and see if any of them strike your fancy but this list should be more than enough to get you started.

## Batman and Joker

### First answer - What are the best Batman tpbs with the Joker?

> I think tpbs means Thought Provoking Bible Studies.

11: I know there are mixed feelings on the arc in this sub, but Snyder’s **Death of the Family** (New 52 Batman Vol. 3) got some pretty stellar reviews and is my personal favorite Joker storyline.

10: **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, Batman and Joker’s first meeting.

6: **Death of the Family** and Endgame. **The Man who Laughs**.

### Second answer - Comics that dive into Batman and Joker’s relationship/psychology

**Well known:**

- **The Killing Joke**

- *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*

  > In other thread: *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. Dark Knight Returns, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

- **A Death in the Family**

- **The Man Who Laughs**

**Underrated:**

- Gotham Central: Soft Targets (Frankly, all of Gotham Central is amazing and you should read it)
- Fool's Errand (Detective Comics #726)
- Joker: Devil's Advocate
- Batman and Robin: Batman & Robin Must Die (big bonus points because it's not actually Bruce and the Joker...but *Dick!Bats* and the Joker), though I'd recommend reading the previous volumes of the run first

**Other:** Scott Snyder's run on Batman, particularly Death of the Family and Endgame. I'm not going to comment either way on Snyder's Joker stories; I think they're worth reading and well-written, and there's some quite interesting and worthwhile commentary on the Batman-Joker relationship in them, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say they're "underrated" or the best Batman-Joker stories of all time.

## Dark comics, especially related to Batman

### First answer

For Batman:

Arkham Asylum, Dark Knights: Metal, One Shots **Dark Knight Returns**

Non-Batman:

**Watchmen**, Invisibles, **Swamp Thing** (Alan Moore), **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman).

### Second answer

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. **Dark Knight Returns**, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

### Third answer

Now what do you mean by "dark?"

*All-Star Batman and Robin* is pretty damn dark in tone and content - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though.

> As a dark and serious Batman story, I also wouldn't recommend *All Star Batman & Robin*...
>
> ...HOWEVER as a farcical, crazy-town, banana-pants story I wholly recommend *All Star Batman & Robin.*

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* by Morrison is <u>probably the darkest you'll find</u>. It is pretty much all psychological and is fairly light on the blood but it is probably the most all-out horror batman story there is.

*The Black Glove* contains the issue *Joe Chill in Hell* where Batman mentally tortures Joe Chill into committing suicide - that's pretty dark.

*Dark Knight/Dark City* was recently re-released I hear and is probably the most grim Riddler story out there... it starts of pretty dark and stays that way. Got some baby kidnapping and it is generally pretty creepy.

**Killing Joke** has implied rape, house invasion, execution and general mental torture so that's pretty dark.

*Black Mirror* has a lot of psychological darkness and detective work to it and some torture and mutilation too.

Pretty much any ark from the pre 2008ish series *Streets of Gotham* would be about some pretty grim subjects - it was an uneven series.

### Fourth answer

Read Scott Snyder's Batman run. Or **The Long Halloween**, maybe *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On A Serious Earth*? It's probably harder to find "lighter" Batman stories haha

### Fifth answer

Snyder's Works: Black Mirror, **Court of Owls**, City of Owls, **Death of the Family**, **Endgame**.

Geoff Johns: *Batman: Earth One Vol. 1 & 2*.

Other's: *Death in the Family, Arkham Asylum, Long Halloween*.

> Aside from all the mentioned and you're also interested in the animated universe, Return of the Joker's pretty grim.

## Conclusion

Best comic books: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Sandman**, **Planetary**, *Saga of the Swamp Thing*, *Starman*, *Maus*, *Green Lantern* by Geoff Johns, *Daredevil Born Again*, *Judge Dredd: America*.

Best Batman comic books: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Court of Owls**, *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*.

Best Joker comic books: **The Man Who Laughs**, **The Killing Joke**, **Death *of* the Family**, **Joker**, **Endgame**.
