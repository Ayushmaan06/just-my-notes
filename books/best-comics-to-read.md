## Various answers

> **Bold** - means a name that people mention a lot.
>
> *Italic* - means a name that people mention a lot, but not as often as **Bold**.

I'm not a fan of this sentiment at all, I don't think anyone gets to decide what makes someone a "true" fan of something and I especially wouldn't say someone wasn't a true fan for not having read books like Age of Ultron and Civil War, highly flawed as they are.

That aside, my favorites that I recommend to everybody:

- **Saga of the Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore & Steve Bisette
- **Planetary** by Warren Ellis & John Cassaday
- Chew by John Layman & Rob Guillory
- **Bone** by Jeff Smith
- Stray Bullets by David Lapham

There can’t really be a MUST read list, because comics appeal to many different audiences for many different reasons.

The best examples of the medium to me are:

1. **Watchmen** is the best example of the possibilities of the medium.
2. **Maus** is memoir and metaphor done to perfection.
3. **From Hell** is literature.
4. **The Dark Knight Returns** is cinema done as a comic, blending perfect imagery to story. 
5. *Daredevil Born Again* is the greatest exploration of who a character is ever executed.

Someone:

> I like this answer because it recognizes that "true comic book fan" should probably include the entire medium and not just one (dominant) genre/region.

---

I can say, Civil War and Age of Ultron, would not be on many lists.

But top 5 I would recommend:

1. A Contract With God
2. **Sandman**
3. Astro City
4. Little Nemo
5. Calvin and Hobbes

---

**STANDALONE STORIES**

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Kingdom Come**
3. Infinity Gauntlet
4. **The Dark Knight Returns**
5. Kraven's Last Hunt

**COMPLETE RUNS**

1. *Daredevil* by Frank Miller
2. **Green Lantern** by Geoff Johns

   > Geoff Johns' entire 9 year run on GL. I don't think anyone can read that entire run without becoming a huge GL fan by the end of it.
3. **Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore
4. Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman
5. Ultimate Spider-Man (Peter Parker) by Brian Michael Bendis

**CURRENT BOOKS**

1. Immortal Hulk by Al Ewing
2. Venom by Donny Cates
3. The Green Lantern by Grant Morrison
4. Your Choice of Amazing Spider-Man by Nick Spencer or Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man by Tom Taylor
5. [reserve spot for Jonathan Hickman's House of X and Powers of X and whatever X-Men stuff of his comes next]

---

2: **Watchmen**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, The Dark Phoenix Saga, **Kingdom Come**, and Kraven’s Last Hunt.

2: Preacher, **Batman: Killing Joke**, Spider Man: Maximum Carnage, **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, XMen: Days of Future Past.

2: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, *Judge Dredd: America*, **The Dark Knight Returns**.

> Judge Dredd america is amazing. Judge Dredd year one is some decent fun.
>
> The problem with cherrypicking Dredd is that the later, longer storylines (that is, the multi-part stories, as *Judge Dredd* is published in serial instalments of eight-or so pages in *2000AD* weekly) are grounded in the world gradually introduced in the earlier self-contained strips. One naturally precedes the other. You could just jump into the *Robot Wars* or *The Cursed Earth* and read them, but while they don't rely on the details of Dredd and his world offered previously, they are augmented by it.
>
> Later stories, such as the classic *America* and *Democracy Now!*, work better by being read in their context - that is, Dredd starting as a sci-fi satire on the Dirty Harry-style antihero, then becoming a popular character for its own sake, and then the writers realizing the need to remind the readers that Dredd, and the entire Judge system, is fascist. That gradual drip-feed of information, text and subtext, is what makes Dredd a truly satisfying epic, forty years old and still going strong.
>
> America is a good introduction, other than the Case Files. It is fantastic. Of course, I may be somewhat biased because that is the only Dredd I have read. However as Hugo said (two big paragraphs above), from what I've heard Dredd, it is best to read most stuff in order.

In no particular order:

- Scott Pilgrim (Brian Lee O’Malley)
- The Vision (Tom King, Gabriel Walta, & Jordie Bellaire)
- Black Hole (Charles Burns) # really hard
- **Watchmen** (Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons)
- **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman & Everyone)
- **Bone** (Jeff Smith)
- Blankets (Craig Thompson)
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Bagley, Stuart Immonen, David LaFuente, & Sara Pichelli)
- Astonishing X-Men (Joss Whedon & John Cassaday)
- **Batman: The Long Halloween** (Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale)
  "+" in other answer: **Kingdom Come** - Even if you don't regularly read their comics, you will know a lot of characters and the art is fantastic.

---

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Sandman**
3. **Planetary**
4. **Saga**
5. Marvels
6. **Kingdom Come**
7. DC: The new frontier
8. Gotham Central
9. Superior foes of Spider-Man
10. Morrison's Animal man

> Where do you suggest to start with marvel? - By Marvels, I assume he means the (excellent) series by Kurt Busiek and and Alex Ross, not the entire Marvel Universe. That would be a tad excessive as a recommendation.

---

James Robinson - *Starman*

Alan Moore - **Saga of the Swamp Thing** # one guy mentioned this in the top and get many votes

Neil Gaiman - **Sandman**

Mark Waid - **Kingdom Come**

Jeff Smith - **Bone**

Warren Ellis - **Planetary** # there were many mentions on Reddit

Dave Sim - Cerebus (up to about issue 150 - there's good stuff after that but only the first half is *essential*)

Brian Michael Bendis - Ultimate Spider-Man

David Lapham - Stray Bullets

John Layman - Chew

> Fuck, I forgot Starman! I have to change my list, shit. Good call.

---

1. All-Star Superman : This is a story that can make even the biggest Superman detractors fall in love with the guy. This is the quintessential Superhero story.
2. **Kingdom Come** : This is an epic. Alex Ross' art gives it the same feel, and it almost feels like mythology. It's amazing.
3. Final crisis : The best of all the crisis, Morrison does something so amazing that I can't even decipher it in a single read. It's the ultimate story, and it reflects why Superman is the greatest superhero.
4. Infinite Crisis : Another Crisis. This shows that we don't need darkness to create good stories. Stories don't need to be dark and edgy for the sake of it. You know what's better than one Superman? Two of them.
5. Geoff Johns' **Green Lantern** : This man brought the GL franchise from zero. He built on the legacy that was left by his previous writers and left it at a level that I don't think any other human can. Such innovation, and so many incredible ideas.

---

143: I really liked the graphic novel **Bone** it had a really interesting story about each character, especially the old humans. It incorporated humor and drama that got me wondering about life in like fifth grade. And of course the Adventures of Tintin.

> Bone is fantastic, even for adults. It is very simple, but absolutely fantastic.

133: Calvin and Hobbes. I understand it is a comic strip and doesnt directly answer your question, but I love the strip and I am counting it.

> Yeah, it's just a charming and funny comic. Love it. I work in a thrift store and the books of the strips come in some times and I make sure to under-price them insanely so someone can have an awesome find.

115: **Saga**. It's a gloriously over-the-top space opera by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples. Violence, adult themes, heart and humour all wrapped up into one longrunning package.

> Also from Vaughn, Y the Last Man, a semi-long running but totally finished work of speculative fiction. Its the story of a man name Yorick and his monkey and they try to make their way through a world following the mysterious death of everyone but them with a Y chromosome.

105:

- [**Sandman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)) - Pretty much the whole series is good,.

- [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(comics)) Start off the the "Hunter Rose Omnibus" for Grendel. Look into the others before buying. Not all of them are as good. 

- Finally, [Cerebus The Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Read it all if you can, from start to finish. It'll take a while, but it's a fucking masterpiece of literature, not just comic books.

  > WARNING ABOUT CERBERUS
  >
  > At one point the creator gets dumped and the book mutates into a weird misogynist screed with page upon page of text and doodles masquerading as a comic.

> I would add: Planetary, and The Authority.

68: All-Star Superman.

> Legit one of the best comic books ever made imo and probably the best Superman story.

51: **Maus** by Art Spiegelman. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/08/11/why-maus-remains-the-greatest-graphic-novel-ever-written-30-years-later/?utm_term=.5e7c7f42833a

51: Scott Pilgrim (all of them)

44: [Old Man Logan](https://youtu.be/cNAD0fTBn2I)

> You want the one (tom) written by Mark Millar.

44: *Preacher*. The show doesn't even compare to how well made the comic is.

> The characters are great. Its the directing they're trying to pace themselves and build up plot but its so damn boring and feels like filler. Why are they using the love triangle arc?? Cassidy was never "in love" with Tulip like in the show. I can tell they're building to where they fight over her and its gonna suck. I wanted the second Season to be about them going to New York and THEN being kidnapped by the L'angels. Sorry long reply.

44: The 2012 run of *Hawkeye* by Matt Fraction. It’s a slow, almost noir-like story about Hawkeye’s everyday life as a single guy in New York who is also a superhero. It’s really brilliant.

24: 
Complete: 

- *Fables* - Fairy tale people live in NY. Eventually there's a big war with their home world.

  > The first arc of Fables dealing with the adversary was great, but it lost steam after that. The first four chapters are still one of my favourite comic arcs.

- **Watchmen** - I thought it was just okay, but the overall consensus is that it's amazing. Realistic super hero story that flips tropes.

- Y: The Last Man - All but let's say one man dies. The world handles that pretty poorly.

- and maybe The Boys - Super heroes are real, but they're more like celebrities. Also they're terrible people deserving of death.

  > For me The Boys swings between trying to catch my breath from laughter, and putting it down and looking for videos of kittens to try and block out the awful.

Still running:

- **Saga** - Do you like a colorful world filled with action and sex? Then you'll love saga.

- The Walking Dead - The pretty good zombie comic that inspired the shitty show. Lulls after the prison, lulls again after All Out War.

  > It's actually completed.

Bonus:

> Finally someone mentions *Transmetropolitan*. It's all the way up there with Sandman and Watchmen for me.
>
> > I'd rate it better than Watchmen, almost as good as The Boys which is  one of my all time favourites.

### Bonus answer - Essential Graphic Novels Everyone Should Read

1. **Maus Complete**. (Includes Maus + Maus II)

2. The Contract With God Trilogy

3. Sin City: The Hard Goodbye

4. **The Watchmen**

5. **Persepolis**

6. The Black Hole

7. Kabuki: Circle Of Blood

8. Ghost In The Shell

9. The Killer

10. Blacksad

    "+" **The Sandman**.

---

38: "From hell" by Alan Moore. Revolves around the mystery of Jack the ripper. With insight to lot of conspiracy theories and postulations. Everything in the book is meticulously detailed and researched, down right the weather of the particular scene. It's extensive and an achievement in the medium. For me from hell represents the maximum potential of the graphic novel as a medium.

27:

- Jimmy Corrigan by Chris Ware
- Love and Rockets by Los Bros Hernandez
- **Maus** by Art Spiegelman
- The Complete Crumb by R. Crumb
- American Splendor by Harvey Pekar
- **Watchmen**, V for Vendetta and **From Hell** by Alan Moore (and Dave Gibbons, David Lloyd and Eddie Campbell)
- Eightball by Daniel Clowes
- Krazy Kat by George Herriman
- A Contract with God by Will Eisner
- **Sandman** by Neil Gaiman and various artists

That was the best I could think of off the top of my head. I'll probably kick myself later for not thinking of others.

Edit: Dammit. I knew I would:

- Prophet by Brandon Graham and Simon Roy
- Black Hole by Charles Burns
- Lone Wolf & Cub by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima
- Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson
- Corpse on the Imjin and Other Stories by Harvey Kurtzman
- Palestine by Joe Sacco
- Tales from the Crypt by Various

> Yeah this is probably the most complete one on the thread. I would add Frank by Jim Woodring, Preacher by Garth Ennis, Peanuts by Charles Schulz, and Fun Home by Alison Bechdel.

21: 

- **Watchmen**

- **Maus**

- **Persopolis**

  > The Persepolis graphic novel goes more in depth than the film, but otherwise is mostly the same

I’d have to add Dark Knight Returns but it has no where near the critical acclaim or mainstream, general recognition of the other three.

> Dark Knight Returns is Frank Miller’s version of an old, embittered Batman. I don’t think Nolan took anything interesting from this version, personally. I love this comic though, I have a hard time deciding if DKR or Watchmen is ‘better’.
>
> This is the book that transformed Batman from the old comedy tv show to the much darker batman we're used to nowadays. It's pretty political though, at least one friend I lent it to didn't like it because he didn't agree with the political statements.

### Bonus answer - the only mention of Transmetropolitan

5: Top Ten by Alan Moore. It's a very non-Alan-Moore-like comic. Fun, entertaining and bright. It's yet another take on his usual schtick ("what if superheroes really existed in the real world") but it's done with a sense of fun and the end result is a great comic book.

4: *Transmetropolitan*, Astro City, and Ultimate Spider-Man.

> Ultimate Spider-Man is probably one of my favorite continuous superhero runs.

3: It depends on what they are looking for. For those who want something outside the realm of Superheroes usually Essex County. For those who want Superhero stories but done in a different way All Star Superman, and for those who just want a great starting point to get into comics usually Ultimate Spider-Man.

### Bonus answer - dark comics, especially related to Batman

For Batman:

Arkham Asylum, Dark Knights: Metal, One Shots **Dark Knight Returns**

Non-Batman:

**Watchmen**, Invisibles, **Swamp Thing** (Alan Moore), **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman).

---

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. **Dark Knight Returns**, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

---

Now what do you mean by "dark?"

*All-Star Batman and Robin* is pretty damn dark in tone and content - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though.

> As a dark and serious Batman story, I also wouldn't recommend *All Star Batman & Robin*...
>
> ...HOWEVER as a farcical, crazy-town, banana-pants story I wholly recommend *All Star Batman & Robin.*

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* by Morrison is <u>probably the darkest you'll find</u>. It is pretty much all psychological and is fairly light on the blood but it is probably the most all-out horror batman story there is.

*The Black Glove* contains the issue *Joe Chill in Hell* where Batman mentally tortures Joe Chill into committing suicide - that's pretty dark.

*Dark Knight/Dark City* was recently re-released I hear and is probably the most grim Riddler story out there... it starts of pretty dark and stays that way. Got some baby kidnapping and it is generally pretty creepy.

**Killing Joke** has implied rape, house invasion, execution and general mental torture so that's pretty dark.

*Black Mirror* has a lot of psychological darkness and detective work to it and some torture and mutilation too.

Pretty much any ark from the pre 2008ish series *Streets of Gotham* would be about some pretty grim subjects - it was an uneven series.

---

Read Scott Snyder's Batman run. Or **The Long Halloween**, maybe *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On A Serious Earth*? It's probably harder to find "lighter" Batman stories haha

---

Snyder's Works: Black Mirror, **Court of Owls**, City of Owls, **Death of the Family**, **Endgame**.

Geoff Johns: *Batman: Earth One Vol. 1 & 2*.

Other's: *Death in the Family, Arkham Asylum, Long Halloween*.

> Aside from all the mentioned and you're also interested in the animated universe, Return of the Joker's pretty grim.

## Opinions about New 52 and Rebirth

> One of the unique features of the DC Universe is the Crisis events. These are events with major consequences for the entire DC multiverse and usually there is a new status quo after each event.
>
> The New 52 was a line-wide relaunch of every DC Comic in 2011. This relaunch was specifically designed to provide new readers with a place to start reading. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[New 52 Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/new-52-reading-order/)** and begin reading.
>
> The latest jumping on point is DC Rebirth (2016). All series were relaunched with the intent to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the “**Flashpoint**” event, while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52. If this is where you want to begin then head over to the [DC Rebirth Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-rebirth-reading-order/) and start reading.

31: It sacrificed decades of character growth for a sales gimmick.

28: 

1. No one knew what was canon and what wasn’t because Batman and GL were in the middle of definitive runs and were selling well, so they didn’t get rebooted at all, but the reboot meant none of their past stories made sense now
2. All of Lee’s buddies seemed to get jobs they didn’t deserve like Liefeld
3. Good creative talent kept leaving because of clashes with editorial like Lemire, Diggle, Cornell, etc
4. A lot of legacy heroes got screwed like Wally West, Tim Drake, Conner Kent, usually acting so different they might as well have been different characters
5. The main characters were changed pretty radically in some ways. Sometimes it worked out like with (imo) Azz WW and Morrison Superman, but even when it did work out, the following creative teams usually did a terrible job

There were still good, definitive runs though like Johns Aquaman or JL, or Snyder Batman. But they just got submerged beneath the tidal wave of crap, especially with DC launching a ton of #1’s all at once.

9: To me, New 52 is a distillation of everything I dislike about DC:

1. Overly edgey stories and ideas (Superman being a jerk and having his parents die in a car accident)
2. A Whatever approach to continuity ( Everything is reset except Batman and Green Lantern even though important DC events happen in Green Lantern and are hinged on Post-Crisis continuity, like Blackest Night)
3. Throwing out or killing legacy characters (Wally is gone, Tim Drake was never Robin or apart of the Bat-family)
4. It plays on an idea Marvel has beaten to death lately; high sales for new number 1s. It works temporarily but sales even out after a while

The real kicker is I started reading comics with New 52 Batman. I appreciate New 52 for being my entryway into comics but can see its glaring flaws.

7: It threw out a bunch of characters that a lot of fans love, or twisted their personalities and origins until they barely resembled themselves.

There were some good things that came out of the New 52 but ultimately it has done far more harm than good. It doesn't help that the damage seems to be permanent at this point :(.

6: It wasn’t a complete reboot. The theory was that everyone got much younger, yet Batman still had all of his family (bar Cass Cain and Steph Brown) and GL still had most of his history intact.

Superman got a complete shaft by being written as more of an arrogant man with no semblance of pre-Flashpoint personality and his parents died because of something Superman could prevent, instead of the heart attack that took Jonathan Kent instead.

Many of the romances and relationships that defined the DC Universe were also phased out of existence, the most notable being Lois and Clark (in favour of WW and Clark), Green Arrow and Black Canary (revisited in Rebirth), Barry and Iris (wasn’t even considered until Rebirth either, and much further down the line) and Wally and Linda Park (which STILL doesn’t even exist).

The history of the Titans and the Young Justice-era Teen Titans were also changed. Conner Kent, Tim Drake and Bart Allen were completely altered, with Conner and Bart missing until recently (Bart returned after Flash War and Conner is coming back soon) and Tim Drake immediately donning the Red Robin mantle instead of having a stint as a Robin himself. Starfire was part of the Outlaws and Beast Boy and Raven weren’t even around. Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal and Garth also seemingly had their own version of the team removed. The Justice Society and the Legion of Superheroes were also a no-show from my knowledge and many characters (Plastic Man, Hawkgirl, Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Wildcat, Dr Fate, Elongated Man, etc.) were missing until Rebirth, and some still are. Martian Manhunter, a member of the original seven, was considered an antihero for a while until he returned in Metal.

While the majority of the New 52 was hard to read (I started with Batman: Hush and the Meltzer JL run, but I started fully investing in the universe when the New 52 came out), some of it turned out great. Snyder’s Batman run, Morrison’s Action Comics, Azzarello’s Wonder Woman, Lemire’s Green Arrow, Geoff Johns’ revitalisations of the Justice League (leading to a culmination in Darkseid War) and Aquaman (setting new precedents and status quo for the character) and the Justice League Dark’s popularity. However, were these things worth the complete culling of DC’s known history up to that point? Absolutely not.

4: Legacy characters got fucked and there was some **BAD** writing

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight.

Even rebirth now is hitting some heavy lows.

2: I think the main reason is because it was so poorly planned. You could tell they had no real idea what they were doing and it just made a mess of things. Big things were set up and then just tossed to the side with no real payoff because they were constantly changing their minds on what they were doing. It just made things so sloppy. You would constantly see things brought up in one book that would contidicted in another because no one knew what was and wasn't part of the Nu52 cannon. This was especially bad on the books with teen characters like Titans since no one knew what the hell was going on with their new histories.

2: It was the time all the executives and editors in DC agreed that maybe the 90s weren't that bad after all.

---

18: Easily rebirth. There was so much trash in the 52. Rebirth is setting things right

8: Rebirth, by a long shot. N52 threw almost everything I cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

4: We had *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*, Animal Man by Jeff Lemire, Wonder Woman by Brian Azarello, Action Comics by Grant Morrison, Justice League by Geoff Johns, Aquaman by Geoff Johns, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, Batwoman by J H Williams.

Personally, that is why I would pick New 52 compared to Rebirth, it just feels like there were stronger titles and iconic storylines unlike Rebirth which feels more like a routine. Yeah, some will see the characters are better but where is the epic ? Where is the stuff that will make someone look back on it in 5 years and say " Damn, Rebirth was THE thing to read "

> 3: Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**.
>
> Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batwoman, Justice League, Bargirl - just to mention a few - had much stronger titles in the New 52. I became a big fan of both Batwoman and Aquaman because of their New 52 runs. If I had read their Rebirth run at the time instead I wouldn’t have been anywhere near as interested in them as I am now.

4: Gotta go with N52. Batman is my 2nd favorite hero of all time and *Snyder's run* was just plain f'cking epic. Tom King's has been meh to eh at best. Otherwise Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and I actually like that.

> 1: The New 52 Batman and New 52 Gl only benefitted from the new 52s darker tones.

4: Didn't New 52 Superman say guns are for sissies to an officer? How is that not being a confident, condescending dick? He didn't say he doesn't need them, he indirectly called all soldiers and cops sissies. Real down-to-earth class act. Just saying.

2: New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2.

2: New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the dc business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga.

---

12: DC New 52 was the Reboot of Comics continuity that started in 2011. It de-aged, rewrote, and threw out a lot classic stories to attract new readers and start from scratch. It officially lasted until 2015, where the books went through a brief "creator orientated" period, that saw many characters go through more apparent changes and stories (Green Lantern a criminal, Superman powerless, Jim Gordan as Batman). The overall consensus of The New 52 was mixed, and a lot of people wanted the old Universe back, or at the very least, start making things like they were.

Rebirth was the 2016 initiation to do just that. Won't explain the story specific details, but know that a lot of characters that have been missing since the Reboot came back, Relationships and Costumes came back, and overall a sense of Time had passed that meant a lot of characters were married again.

Recommendations! *BATMAN: NEW 52 By Scott Snyder*. This is a 50 issue run and has its highs and lows, but this was the star of the New 52 for a while. It also acts as a great Satellite Book incase you want to jump over to The other Bat Family books.

*Geoff Johns's GREEN LANTERN Saga*. It's 10 years long, and it brought back the Green Lanterns into the spotlight.

Lois and Clark is a good one. All you need to know is that the Superman and Lois from the old Universe, before the Reboot, have made it to the new one and are living it out in secret, Raising their son.

GRAYSON. First Robin, Formerly Nightwing, Now secret Agent. Dick Grayson must go undercover and attempt to figure out what plans SPYRAL have. Very fun read.

TITANS HUNT (2015). It's one of the DC Books between New 52 and Rebirth, and basically brings back the Original Titan members again.

THE FINAL DAYS OF SUPERMAN.

DC UNIVERSE REBIRTH SPECIAL. This is where it begins. it's a massive 80 page one shot that sets up the Future of the DC Universe and what Rebirth has in store.

For Rebirth, I would suggest the following (NOTE: Pick up "Title Name": Rebirth and then the main title with the Rebirth banner)

SUPERMAN

TITANS (not Teen)

GREEN ARROW

RED HOOD AND THE OUTLAWS

HAL JORDAN AND THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS

WONDER WOMAN

DEATHSTROKE

Alternatively, if 10 years of Green Lantern is too much for you, you could instead go with GREEN LANTERNS (2016). It's meant as a jumping off point for new readers who don't know a lot about the Lantern mythos. Plus, 2 rookie lanterns!

6: I'd say the *New52* was a much harder reboot than *Rebirth* was. Characters like Superman and Wonder Woman, got all new backstories, and stories were erased from continuity. It was kinda a mess. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision.

*Rebirth* is about bringing back aspects of the pre-*Flashpoint* continuity, while altering character's continuity and backstories (such as Superman, Deathstroke and Wonder Woman).

---

6: The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

I wouldn't think of it as New 52 versus Rebirth. Just read the best titles of each:

- [**New 52** Recommended Reading Survey Results](http://i.imgur.com/Rhq72HB.jpg)
- [**Rebirth** Recommended Reading Survey Results](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV)

2: Skip to Rebirth.

> Well Rebirth is often undo what New 52 created. So if choose to read N52, you are probably read a story has been [retcon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=retcon) or has status it never happen.

---

8: Continuity wise, you could read the Rebirth books and be fine (it's meant to be a jumping on point for new readers anyway), but there are definitely some New 52 titles worth reading imo.

*Batman*, Batman and Robin, Grayson, Omega Men, Justice League, and *Swamp Thing* are all worth reading from the New 52.

---

18: Start anywhere you want. If you encounter something confusing, either keep reading comics until it makes sense or Google it. Here are some rankings of newer comics:

[Rebirth](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV) survey results (May 2017).

[New 52](http://imgur.com/Rhq72HB) survey results (February 2014).

8: Except for *Batman* and *Green Lantern*, "Rebirth" is more trur to DC characters, so I would start with Rebirth.

4: New 52 *Batman* and *Green Lantern* yes. Jeff Lemire's Green Arrow yes. Damian By Tomasi yes. Superman Lois and Clark yes. I would also check out Omega Men. There might be some others from the N52 era I am missing.

Rebirth has been killer top to bottom for the most part. The stuff I am reading is Superman from Tomasi, Super Sons from Tomasi, Green Arrow, Batman, Green Lanterns, All Star Batman. Only major complaint I have is that some stories are slow moving. Trinity, Justice League. For example.

6: Rebirth, no doubt. New 52 made me dislike reading DC comics. However, "Death of the Family" and "Night of the Owls" are amazing reads, you should check it out.

> 13: The New 52 Flash series (when Francis Manapul was on it) was REALLY good. As was *Scott Snyder's entire Batman run*, Geoff Johns Justice League run, King's Grayson, etc. And I can't forget John's Aqusman run, which helped redefine the character for a new age.
>
> The New 52 had a lot of bad (Like Teen Titans), but it also had a lot of good and great stories. It helped get A LOT of people back into comics, and DC wouldn't have the success it has now with Rebirth w/o it 
>
> > 3: I was surprised with how good Aquaman and Flash were. Unpopular opinion: Blue Beetle, Green Arrow and Batwing were actually decent (which was something I wasn't expecting). On the other hand, series like Teen Titans, Red Hood, Batwoman and many more were so disappointing...

3: The best thing in the New 52, hands down, was Brian Azarello's Wonder Woman. Other things are hit and miss. The DCYou stuff starting about 30 issues in got a bit better (Commish Gordon as a reluctant Batman was fun af).

Rebirth is all pretty good.

2: This is how i got into comics...

I would start with the New 52 but only the very best titles:

Aquaman by Geoff Johns

The Flash by Francis Manapul

*Batman by Scott Snyder*

*Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*

And maybe some other like Wonder Woman by Brian Azzarello and Justice League by Geoff Johns if you want.

Then if any of those characters in those stories interest you, i would go back and read some of their best Pre-Flashpoint stories.

Once you have done this i would start reading Rebirth. You can however, go straight from the New 52 to Rebirth and enjoy the great stuff Rebirth has been putting out so far but i will say that Rebirth (while great on its own) does not have nearly as big of an impact as it does if you know some of the Pre-Flashpoint history and characters (that doesnt mean all of it by any means as i know that might sound daunting but just some).

2: This is very good guide with best starting points and breef explanations of each one: https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/

1: Depends on who you want to start with. If you like Batman, his New 52 stories were pretty much all good so you could start there. If you wanted to start with someone like Superman or Green Arrow, then I would suggest starting with Rebirth because their N52 stories were a little shaky in terms of quality.

1: I'd say read *New 52 Batman*, GL, Flash, Forever Evil, and Grayson.

1: Rebirth but the New 52 might be worth reading for its Batman series.

1: Dedicate yourself to rebirth however go back and read some of the most popular stories from New 52.

Scott Synders batman run and Geoff John's Aquaman run are some of the best reads you can ask for.

1: Rebirth overall seems to be slightly higher quality. But n52 had a lot of great titles. For me *Swamp Thing* is a MUST read. Animal Man alongside it is great also. *Batman*, Action Comics, Wonder Woman and Flash were all solid and Justice League is good fun too!

### Conclusion on New 52 and Rebirth

#### General consensus on New 52

This was a mess. New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the DC business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision. Many characters were been defaced and reworked, many cool characters from the previous runs were deleted from the continuous such as Wally West. Plus, there was some **BAD** writing. 

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight. Although, some runs and books are worth attention: *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*. People say strange thing about New 52 Batman (Gordon as Batman, what?), but they also say that it's well written. By the way, many people say that New 52 is more darker than Rebirth.

#### General consensus on Rebirth

In general, it is was a step in right direction. DC continued New 52, but they returned old comic book spirit. N52 threw almost everything people cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**. New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2. Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and some people actually like that which I don't like.

---

So, I will definitely read the best runs and stories from the New 52, but I don't think I will like Rebirth. According to the words, it sounds like a fan service.

## Superhero comic books - best books and where to start

### Batman

> [Batman - essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/essentials) on Reddit.

---

21: If you like a dark story with a twist, try **The Long Halloween** and its sequel, **Dark Victory**.

11: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory** (sequel to TLH), Hush, Under The Red Hood, Black Mirror, and **The Court of Owls**.

> Someone: I really enjoyed Zero Year as a starting point. Year One is a different comics.

8: The right answer is always **The Court of Owls** (The New 52) for new readers. It's the perfect starting point.

> Court of Owls is pretty dark IMO. # analyzing the comments, I can tell you that's not exactly true.

---

For a starter I would say read Batman **Year One** or the **Killing Joke**. Basically the greats. After that it's pretty much a pick your own buffet. My personal favorites are no mans land (Batman helping Gotham in a huge earthquake) , **The Court of Owls** (new villians. As namesake) , the world's finest (Batman and Superman team up, its nothing like the movies )

> Watching or reading Batman: Year One first? - I'm biased due to Year One being one of my favorites, but I say read it first. Its not duper long, but it's fantastic. Just a warning though, it's just as much a Gordon story as a Batman one.

Edit: there was one comic or short that was damn good, it was about Batman's psyche and it ended with Batman in a sewer who could not let go of his guns.

I really recommend you to read it if anyone can help identify it.

---

6: Have a go at grant Morrison’s Arkham asylum and Alan Moore’s **the killing joke**. Both dark, and the art ok Arkham asylum is awesome.

> Edit: killing joke not man who laughs.
>
> Right after that, please, please, please read Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns.

5: Must reads are **Killing Joke** by Alan Moore and Hush by Jeph Loeb, both are extremely dark and the best batman books to date in my opinion. If you don't mind a Dick Grayson Batman, try Black Mirror as well, it is extremely dark.

4: **The Dark Knight Returns** is about a Batman who come out of retirement because Gotham’s gone to hell. He’s unleashed, uncappable of holding back. It’s absolutely amazing. Skip watching the animated movies until you’ve read the comic. It’s only four issues.

---

7: **The Court of Owls** is where I would start. It's modern and one of the best Batman stories ever. It's volume 1 of Scoot Snyder's Batman. If you like it, it runs for like 8 volumes.

You are going to get a lot of recommendations for **Year One** and **The Dark Knight Returns**. They are considered Batman classics, but IMO they don't hold up extremely well.

**The Long Halloween** is another one you can jump into without much knowledge of Batman. It's sequel is **Dark Victory**.

3: All New 52. **Killing Joke**. **Year One**. **The Dark Knight Returns**. Batman: The White Knight. Batman Hush. Batman The Black Mirror. Batman Death in the Family. Batman Under the Hood

2: **Batman Year One**. **The dark knight returns** **The long Halloween** **The killing joke** **Dark Victory** Grant Morrison’s Batman run Scott Snyder’s Batman Run

> EDIT: also Batman Earth One by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank.

#### The Joker

*Comics:*

- **The Man Who Laughs**
- **The Killing Joke** (seems to be the most relevant to what the upcoming Joker film is going for)

(I haven’t read ”Death in the Family” yet, so I didn’t list it, but I heard it’s a classic. I also heard “**Death *of* the Family**” is very good, and there’s a DC Essential Edition of it coming up)

There’s also “The Three Jokers” coming up by Geoff Johns.

*Films:*

- Batman (1989)
- The Dark Knight (2008)
- Under the Red Hood (an animated film that revolves around the aftermath of “Death in the Family”)

*Video Games:*

- The Arkham Trilogy (even in Knight, the Joker plays a big role).

> Someone: 
>
> Joker by Azzarello is good.
>
> Death of the Family by Snyder and Capullo is probably my favorite.
>
> The last one is collected into a single volume that makes it easier to read for a guy who's not big into comics, as you said.

---

I loved Batman: White Knight personally - definitely recommend you read it. You may also like some of the New 52 stuff (**Death of The Family** is the one you hear most often but chronologically I'm not sure where it's placed).

> The New 52 is Death **of** the Family, which I agree is really good. A Death **in** the Family is the post-crisis story, that I find terrible. Just wanted to clear it up for OP.

##### What is your favorite joker story?

You should probably add '*besides the Killing Joke*' because well obviously.

> Then the obvious answer would be "The Laughing Fish".

Endgame.

If I were to choose something besides **The Killing Joke** or "The Laughing Fish", it would be "Dreadful Birthday, Dear Joker".

After **The Killing Joke**, **The Man Who Laughs**.

##### What is the DARKEST Joker story in the Batman comics?

20: If you don't think the Joker from Snyder and Capullo's New 52 run is dark and twisted enough, then I don't know what's wrong with you. That's the most sadistic version I've seen yet.

> Death of the Family and Endgame from New 52 focus on Joker, and they're both great.

> The entire Snyder New 52 run of Batman is fantastic.

20: **Death of the Family**, Endgame, **The Killing Joke**, Brian Azzarello's Joker, **The Man Who Laughs**.

8: Obvious answer is **The Killing Joke** but I think Brian Azzarello's 'Joker' graphic novel is even more unsettling, especially the scene with Frost's ex-wife.

> Joker by Brian Azzerello is fantastic.

##### Joker Comic Reading List

My number 1 personal recommendation is **The Killing Joke** its widely considered to be one of the best joker stories out there and in my opinion is the best. It was the first comic book I read and what hooked me on the character so I may be biased in this regard but I really can't think of a better jumping off point for a new comic book reader in general or a new batman reader or just a new reader to the Joker. Writer Alan Moore gives a gripping and terrifying story focusing more on the Joker then Batman while also exploring one of the possible origin stories for the character all in all it's one of the best characterizations out there along with Brian Bollands beautiful artwork it becomes a must-read for Joker fans.( just make sure to get the deluxe edition which was published years later and includes updated coloring that improves the quality of the whole book even more most comic book shops will exclusively sell the deluxe edition so it shouldn't be a problem but just in case I should mention it if you're not experience with comics)

Next down from that is **Death Of The Family** ( not to be confused with death in the family which is the story of how Jason Todd the second Robin was murdered by the Joker it's an iconic story and undoubtedly an important event in Batman mythos however I personally am not fond of the overall storyline finding it a bit sloppy but feel free to check it out for yourself at your local library or read couple panels at a bookstore and decide) admittedly the new 52 provided a lot of controversial storylines that divided the fan base, however Scott Snyder set out to write a horror story set in the universe of Batman and did so expertly by putting him up against the Joker with the stakes higher than they've ever been. In the start of the new 52 the Joker vanished from Arkham Asylum leaving his face sliced off and nail to wall this story picks up one year later where the Joker is back and has stolen his face back to wear like a mask. Somewhere in the demented brain of his he has come to the conclusion that all of Batman's allies are wearing him down and preventing him from being the best superhero he can be so he decided the only logical conclusion is to take them out one by one this is a massive crossover event between multiple comics that when collected together is genuinely chilling and provides an excellent cross section of the jokers personality as well as giving an excellent look into the relationship between Batman and the Joker. Along with that Greg Capullos art renders the whole thing beautifully horrifying( side note since this is a crossover between multiple publications what you don't want to do is buy a trade paperback of one and wound up with a fifth of the story. On the cover it should say the name of the publication along with the title. Ie. Catwoman- Death of the family. Most comic book shops if you say that you want the entire collected storyline they will be able to provide you with it just in case I bought my copy of Barnes and Noble and to be recognizable this edition has a cover printed with Joker- death of the family. As the title.)

Next isn't really Joker story per se however it does feature the Joker and is a very memorable storyline **The Dark Knight Returns** by Frank Miller is regarded in the comic book world as being one of the greatest comic books ever written as it brought Batman back to his dark roots. In this story it takes place 10 years in the future where Batman is 60 years old and retired however he comes out of retirement to save Gotham City along the way his coming out of retirement will awaken several supervillains have lain dormant including the Joker who returns to have a little fun and put a stop to batman and also super man who is working for the government who comes to odds with Batman in the climax of the story. Again while not featuring The Joker as the prominent focus of the story it does give an excellent cross-section into Batman's personality and one cannot truly understand one without the other. In addition this is going to be the inspiration for the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie will draw from prominently. (Disclaimer the art style of Frank Miller is somewhat of an acquired taste and is perhaps not the best first impression for inexperienced readers.)

one I can think of right now is **Endgame** which also written by Snyder with the same art as the the death of the family is the follow up to the death of the family signaling the return of the Joker after those events and exploring yet another possible origins for him however keeping in history with the Joker they never actually give a concrete yes or no as to what his origin story is always keeping a moving target admittedly I have not read the story myself however I have heard that it is entertaining for my local comic book store and will undoubtedly give it a read ( side note I would not recommend this starting off not only because of the fact that it is a follow up to a different book but also the controversial nature of the story which divided the fan base yet again read a couple other of these stories and come back to this one after you've read and liked DOTF)

Simply titled **Joker** by Brian Azzarello tell the story of the Joker being released from prison and his ride back to power with Gotham's underworld told from the point of view of one of his goons Johnny frost. This story in particular is unique because it never actually shows Batman. It does however show the brutal nature of the Joker and his unstable personality from the outsiders pov giving readers a look in. Because this story is set outside of ordinary continuity the writers were free to explore the character in a new way. The unique art style is done less like a comic drawing and more like oil paintings showcasing several iconic Batman villains. If you enjoyed Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character in The Dark Knight this one is definitely for you as he drew heavily from this graphic novel as inspiration from everything to his general appearance to the way in which the character interacts with the supporting characters.

Lastly is "**The Man Who Laughs** written as a follow up to a year one which was the origin story of Batman this story is essentially a retelling of a classic story from 1940 the one in which Batman first comes to head with the Joker. Now I personally like this story purely because of its principal taking a story that nobody will realistically get to read unless they come for 75 years of comics updating the art style to a more modern setting and sending it back out I really can't say anymore about this book but if you're looking for a good Joker story this is definitely one to check out.

Side note please keep in mind that this is a character with a 75 year lineage and that his character has been told many times by many different authors so there are hundreds of storylines graphic novels and trade paperbacks that feature him as the main character that I am probably leaving out these are only the ones that I have read and enjoyed this being my favorite character. So I encourage you if there's a comic book store near you to go and just check out the rack of Joker comics there and see if any of them strike your fancy but this list should be more than enough to get you started.

#### Batman and Joker

###### First answer - What are the best Batman tpbs with the Joker?

> I think tpbs means Thought Provoking Bible Studies.

11: I know there are mixed feelings on the arc in this sub, but Snyder’s **Death of the Family** (New 52 Batman Vol. 3) got some pretty stellar reviews and is my personal favorite Joker storyline.

10: **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, Batman and Joker’s first meeting.

6: **Death of the Family** and Endgame. **The Man who Laughs**.

###### Second answer - Comics that dive into Batman and Joker’s relationship/psychology

**Well known:**

- **The Killing Joke**

- *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*

  > In other thread: *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. Dark Knight Returns, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

- **A Death in the Family**

- **The Man Who Laughs**

**Underrated:**

- Gotham Central: Soft Targets (Frankly, all of Gotham Central is amazing and you should read it)
- Fool's Errand (Detective Comics #726)
- Joker: Devil's Advocate
- Batman and Robin: Batman & Robin Must Die (big bonus points because it's not actually Bruce and the Joker...but *Dick!Bats* and the Joker), though I'd recommend reading the previous volumes of the run first

**Other:** Scott Snyder's run on Batman, particularly Death of the Family and Endgame. I'm not going to comment either way on Snyder's Joker stories; I think they're worth reading and well-written, and there's some quite interesting and worthwhile commentary on the Batman-Joker relationship in them, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say they're "underrated" or the best Batman-Joker stories of all time.

#### Harley Quinn

**Batman: Mad Love**. I feel like it's the only good Harley comic. I personally think she hasn't been that great since B:TAS, but that's just me. Batman Adventures: My Boyfriend's Back and A Wedding to Die For are also gems.

Harley and Ivy is also a lot of fun but it's nothing serious. Her Pre New 52 solo run was okay until the team changed and then it became unbearable.

In the New 52 she has gone through so many changes, in one issue she was killing 20 kids with bombs, in another she was shown with puppies and being a sweetheart. The New 52 Suicide Squad run was atrocious imo, and Palmiotti and Conner write her as Deadpool basically with same randomness and insanity.

### Green Lantern

Most people would tell you to start with **Green Lantern: Rebirth**, but I think that story is a bit confusing for a new reader. So here is a list of the events that take place before that story in chronological order. The **bold** ones are a part of Geoff John's run while the *italic* ones are from the 90's:

**Green Lantern: Secret Origin**

*Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight/New Dawn*

*Zero Hour: Crisis in Time*

*The Final Night*

*Day of Judgment*

**Green Lantern: Rebirth**

### Hellboy

25: Hellboy isn't like most superhero comics where there's multiple "runs" to keep track of. Nearly all of it is written by Mike Mignola and nearly all of it is worth reading. Just start at the beginning with [Hellboy, Volume 1: *Seed of Destruction*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593070942) and follow the rest in [suggested reading order](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2017/).

> Updated version of the reading order: [link](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2019/).

9: Mignola writes all of Hellboy and co-writes most of the tie-ins if not all, the universe is pretty amazing just in itself, can't go wrong with Mignola.

7: There is only one Hellboy run, and that's the Mike Mignola one that begins with *Seed of Destruction*. It is available in regular trades that collect roughly four to six issues each, or the oversized Library Edition hardcovers which collect twice that much. This is also due to be released Omnibus form starting this year.

There's one main BPRD run split into three cycles, *Plague of Frogs*, Hell on Earth and The Devil You Know. I would recommend starting *Plague of Frogs* once you've reached at least volume 4 of Hellboy, Conqueror Worm (this is fifth), which is what Plague of Frogs follows directly on from. There are some lovely paperback and hardcover collections of PoF available for reasonable prices, and HoE is also due to have some released soon. TDYK has only just started so is currently only available in single issues, but give it time.

There are also the prequel miniseries Hellboy & The BPRD, and BPRD 1946, 1947 and 1948. These are prequels and as such don't have to be read at any particular point, but I'd at least recommend reading BPRD 1947 before starting BPRD: Hell On Earth as a character is introduced in 1947 who comes back and has a large part to play in HoE.

There is also the Abe Sapien solo series, which happens mostly alongside BPRD: Hell on Earth. Abe runs away from the BPRD during this period, so if you want to know what he's up to, read the Abe Sapien solo series. Otherwise it is not necessary to the main BPRD plot.

> 5: I would add a few things to this.
>
> The sapien series will likely be more important to the overall plot in the next cycle of bprd. And Hellboy and the BPRD is a full ongoing series but likely not important to the future and mignola wrote or was heavily involved in at least half of it as of now so it's still one run basically.

---

16: The spin-offs are just as good. I recommend *Frankenstein Underground*, I'm a sucker for the Frankenstein myth and the series does not disappoint.

12: Comic Hellboy is just a lot more fun than the movie version. The del Toro movies are totally fine, but Hellboy always sort of annoyed me in them. He's sort of a whiney teen in them. I much prefer him as a grouchy old man.

I think BPRD is one of the best long form comics we have as well. They do a great job of creating a lot of finality. When people fuck up, there are lasting consequences. You get to also see this crew develop from being a regular team to these hardened war vets.

9: They absolutely are; those and especially BPRD are among the best that comics have to offer

8: Abe has his own set of comics as well. I think his are set while Hellboy is in hell.

---

> Essential/Best Hellboy Comics?

5: I may missing some, but here is what I think

- Seed of Destruction (Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- Wake the Devil (Hellboy – Volume 2: Wake the Devil, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- The Nature of the Beast (Hellboy – Volume 4: The Right Hand of Doom, Omnibus: Hellboy: The Complete Short Stories – Volume 1)
- The Corpse (Hellboy – Volume 3: The Chained Coffin and Others, Omnibus: Hellboy: The Complete Short Stories – Volume 1)
- Almost Colossus (Hellboy – Volume 3: The Chained Coffin and Others, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- *Conqueror Worm* - here is where he leaves the BPRD (Hellboy – Volume 5: Conqueror Worm, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 2: Strange Places</u>)
- Darkness Calls (Hellboy – Volume 8: Darkness Calls, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- The Wild Hunt (Hellboy – Volume 9: The Wild Hunt, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- Storm & Fury (Hellboy – Volume 12: The Storm and the Fury, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>, Hellboy – Volume 12: The Storm and the Fury, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- Hellboy in Hell - end of series (everything in <u>Hellboy Omnibus – Volume 4: Hellboy in Hell</u>)

There's much more, but I would consider those to be the most essential for understanding the whole story without being too confused.

> Conqueror worm is my favourite of the comics and is really a defining point in hellboy’s character.

---

5: Main Hellboy: The Troll Witch, *Conquerer Worm*, The Third Wish, The Crooked Man, The Wild Hunt

Spin-offs: BPRD - The Long Death

3: Anything written and drawn by Mignola is great. Anything by him and Fegredo or Corben is also great.

The BPRD stuff is mostly good and the minis of the side characters tend to vary in quality.

> +People say that *Lobster Johnson* is also good series.

### Swamp Thing

7: Len Wein's *Roots of the Swamp Thing* collects the first appearances of Swampy and establishes some of the main characters that would be used later. Then, move on to the first volume of Alane Moore's **Saga of the Swamp Thing** and work your way up to the sixth volume.

10: *New 52's* (I think he means Swamp Thing by Snyder) not a bad place to start, although Alan Moore's run is a better place to start (and also just better in general).

---

16: Moore's run redefined the character and is held up as the gold-standard.

Other than that, the recent series by Snyder and then Soule was pretty good.

I also think Nancy Collins run is underrated.

7: Moore's run is not only the best Swap Thing run but also one of the best comic book series ever. Some issues read similar to a prose novel. I honestly don't think there's anything quite like it.

5: Besides the obvious, I would recommend the original Len Wein run, collected in *Roots of the Swamp Thing* and if you want that plus all of pre-Moore Bronze Age Swamp Thing material (besides crossovers) it's all been collected in one of those [new monster omnibuses.](https://www.amazon.com/Swamp-Thing-Bronze-Omnibus-Vol/dp/1401273785) The run preceding Moore's does have plot elements that Moore follows on, so it might give you more of an appreciation for his stuff.

1: I feel the Moore run doesn't really have as much weight behind it without having read any of the previous stuff. At the very least read either the "Dark Genesis" or "Roots of the Swamp Thing" trade first so you can get context for his relationships with Abby and Anton, along with Matthew Cable. After that, you can probably jump to the first Saga of the Swamp Thing trade without missing much.

> Both have the 1st appearance of ST, along with the first 10 or 13 issues respectively.
>
> Apparently there's also a collection called Swamp Thing - Bronze Age and the first volume has the same material of "Roots", but it has a different title.
>
> Boy, I wonder why people have problems getting into comic books.

---

16: Start with Book One and read the subsequent trades. Alan Moore started writing the series at #20 and <u>wrapped up the previous writer’s storyline</u>. #21 (The Anatomy Lesson) is where the series starts to become an all-time great.

Don’t get thrown off too much by the numbering. I’ve never read #1-19 and it’s never affected my enjoyment of the series.

> It's all confusing, I know, but that's why most new reader advice avoids talking about all of this. I usually just say "Here, read this" instead of info-dumping about how the entire industry works. That's another reason publisher's label comics as "Book One". There should be no confusion about which book to buy first—it's book 1. Only the more inquisitive readers like yourself notice the comic numbering and think "Am I buying the right thing?" At that point, the publisher is thinking "Ugh, the Book One thing wasn't clear enough. Maybe we should just get rid of the comic numbering altogether to make it more obvious for the newbies." But then consumers would outcry "Now we can't see which issues are collected in this book! CROOKERY!" Again, more confusing meta-info a new reader doesn't need to worry about.

### The Flash

12: Wally West recommendations:

The Flash: Reverse by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: History Lessons by Brian Buccellato

>3: The first three of these are really good imo

10: Pre-Flashpoint Barry Allen recommendations:

The Flash: Rebirth by Geoff Johns

The Flash: *The Dastardly Death of the Rogues by Geoff Johns*

The Flash: *The Road to Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

*Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

4: If you want to read about Barry Allen specifically, then The Flash vol. 1: Move Forward is a pretty good place to start, and very new-reader-friendly. (The current "Flash" series that begins with *The Flash vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice* is also very popular, but I haven't read it so I can't comment.)

If you're up for reading about any Flash then I recommend checking out *Mark Waid's run* from the 1990s, which stars Wally West. This is currently being reprinted in paperback form as The Flash by Mark Waid — there are three volumes out so far. The first volume contains a flashback origin story, "Born to Run", so it's a really good introductory point too. (Be warned, though, that the annuals and the "Flash Special" contained in that volume are nowhere near as good as Mark Waid's run ends up becoming, so don't be put off.)

---

17: Best:

*Mark Waid's run* (The Flash vol 2 #62-129,#142-163 plus some other crossover issues and one shots, will be collected in trades soon as The Flash by Mark Waid Books One to ___). By far the best Wally West run and the best Flash run in general, most modern ideas about the character come from his run. Everything from speedforce to the Flash family was from Waid. It's the best example of a legacy character in comics and has the best character growth I've ever read and it's the reason so many people loved the DCU Rebirth one shot.

Almost the Best:

Geoff Johns' first run (The Flash vol 2 #164-225 plus some crossover issues and one shots. Currently being reprinted as The Flash by Geoff Johns with the third trade coming out in a few months). Following on directly from Waid, this was Geoff Johns' third comics which makes it quite impressive. While he may not have had the grand ideas and perfect voice for Wally that Waid had he did one thing better: the villains. Throughout the run Johns gives the best writing for the Rogues that you will see as well as other villains like Grodd and even a new one, Zoom. It all culminates in Rogue War which was a great finale to the run and a great ending to the greatest (IMO) era of the Flash (1990-2005).

Grant Morrison's and Mark Millar's run (The Flash vol 2 #130-141 and some crossover issues. All collected in one trade a few months ago as The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar). Set during Mark Waid's littel break this run features short, bizarre, silver age style stories with some of the most badass and overpowered feats ever in Flash history (like Wally winning a race against instant transportation). There's also a really nice single issue that will make you love Jay Garrick.

Infantino/Broome's (and Fox's) run (The Flash vol 1 #105-174, also lets throw showcase #4, #8, #13, and #14 in there. Being collected in trade as The Flash: The Silver Age with one volume already out as well as omnibus with the second out later in the year). This might be a bit much for you if you can't handle silver age comics. This is the original Barry Allen stuff that brought about the silver age. It features lots of really wacky, bizarre and outrageous sci-fi/superhero stories. Also Infantino is the definitive Flash artist.

Others worth reading:

William Mesner-Loeb's run (The Flash vol 2 #15-61, though it takes a bit to get up to standard. No reprints). Criminally underrated even by me since very few people bring it up. It's a very good look at a young adult Wally who is still immature and learning how to be a proper adult hero. It has a really great supporting cast and also introduces Linda Park, who Mark Waid later builds upon to write the best relationship on comics.

The Flash: Dastardly Death of the Rogues (and while not collected in the trade, I'll throw in The Flash vol 3 #8). This is part of Johns' second run, this time featuring Barry (Rebirth 09, Blackest Night: Flash, Flash vol 3, Flashpoint) and is the only story where Johns got things properly right (the rest suffers from what felt like an editorial agenda to push Barry and screw over the other characters, plus the other stories have some general writing issues). This also happens to be my favourite Barry story due to the excellent writing and the gorgeous art by Manapul and Buccellato (easily my favourite Flash art). All you really need to know is that it's Barry finally settling in and getting back to business after coming back to life (he was dead from 1985-2008, he saved the universe/multiverse).

New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Thankfully DC's recent Rebirth relaunch is bringing things back with DCU Rebirth #1, *The Flash Rebirth* #1 (2016) + The Flash (2016) ongoing series, and Titans Rebirth #1 + Titans ongoing series.

---

5: Summarize:

The Flash (2011) #0-25 [Origin and a good introduction to The Flash's villains]

*The Flash: Rebirth* (2016) [Re-introduces the history of The Flash which was forgotten]

Then you have two options:

Option 1: The Flash (2016) #1-Present [Upcoming arc is an expanded origin story]

Option 2: The Flash (1987) #62-118 [*Mark Waid's classic run*, which features Wally West as The Flash instead of Barry Allen]

If you want to know why Wally West became The Flash, read Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986), but this is very new-reader unfriendly and requires extensive knowledge of DC Comics history.

4: Starting from the beginning is a long journey, the *Mark Waid series* are good but it’s Wally west. Rebirth is a good Barry Allen jump on point. They’re about to do flash year 1 to give a back story of the new 52/review the flash.

5: Barry Allen started his carrier in the comics in 1956 until 1985 and then he was absent on until 2009. His modern-age series called [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) when he returned. After that 2 trades came (In comics, a trade paperback (often shortened to trade) is a collection of stories originally published in comic books, reprinted in book format, usually capturing one story arc from a single title or a series of stories with a connected story arc or common theme.) called [*The Flash Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Dastardly-Rogues-Brightest/dp/1401231950/) and [*The Flash Vol. 2: The Road to Flashpoint*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Flashpoint-Comics-Unnumbered/dp/1401234488).

After these, a HUGE event came that changed everything called [Flashpont](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384) that "reset" the continuity and started the New 52 age and it's first story-line called [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or alternatively [The Flash: Starting Line (DC Essential Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Starting-Line-DC-Essential/dp/1401284760)) This series (New52) lasted till Spring 2016 and collected 9 trades (the show you watched is based on this era). In early 2016 [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) came (only name change, everything is continued from New52) but a huge exception: a long missing character came back to the grand scene who was missing for so long. Rebirth's first trade is [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X)

So if you are interested in Barry (overall) start with [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) and move onward to [*Flashpont*](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384), but you can just start with [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) and [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X), then read everything up to today. (currently there is a Flash event called Flash War coming out)

But if you are interested in old material, the best place to start is [The Flash: The Silver Age Vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Silver-Age-Vol/dp/1401261108), the first comics where Barry showed up.

(there is an omnibus on sale at the moment (a collection of multiple trades) called [The Flash By Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato Omnibus](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Francis-Manapul-Buccellato-Omnibus/dp/1401261035/) that collects the first 4 trades of the New 52 era.

2: *Flash by Mark Waid* volumes 1-5 Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar Flash by Geoff Johns volumes 1-5

Baron and Messner-Loebs runs are solid as well and do a lot of character development Flash volume 2 issues 1-63

Secret Origins Annual 2 is an awesome Flash story

2: *Flash by Mark Waid vol 1* Flash by Geoff Johns vol 1 Flash by Manapul and Buccellato Flash Rebirth

---

15: The best Flash run is *Mark Waid's run*. Waid built up the Flash Family and introduced the Speedforce into the DC Universe.

That run easily has some of the best Flash stories ever. The only catch is that it's Wally West Flash. Barry Allen sacrificed his life during an event called Crisis on Infinite Earths and Wally took up the mantle.

If you like Barry in the show you'll like Wally in the comics. Wally from the comics is much more similar to Grant Gustin's Flash than the actual Barry from the comics.

[r/theflash](https://www.reddit.com/r/theflash/) has a reading recommendations list for both Barry and Wally. Here's the order I'd recommend for both Barry and Wally

**Reading order for Wally**:
*The Flash by Mark Waid*:
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)

> it's actually released.

*Waid takes a break here*
**The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar (One trade only)**
*Waid comes back here*
**The Flash by Mark Waid**
Book 6(Not released yet)
**The Flash by Geoff Johns**
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)
*Barry Comes Back*
Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*

**Reading Order for Barry**
*The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*
*Flashpoint*
New52 Flash
DC Rebirth #1
*Flash: Rebirth* (2016)

5: *Mark Waid's Flash* (1992-2000) is the best Flash I have ever read, though, granted, I haven't read much else besides his run. I especially like his later stuff, like the "Dark Flash Saga."

> IIRC Dark Flash Saga was never collected in a trade and can only be read through the individual issues (#152-#159). It'll probably be hard to find physical copies but I'm sure if you look hard enough you'd find them somewhere. They are also available in digital copies on Comixology and other digital sites.

3: The Flash | #0, 62-129, 142-159, 162, 231-236; annual 4-6, 8; etc. | 1992-2008 | *Waid*

The Flash | #130-138 | 1997-1998 | Morrison, Millar

The Flash | #164-225, Rogues' Revenge #1-3, Rebirth #1-6, #1-12, etc. | 2000-2011 | Johns

*Flashpoint* | #1-5 | 2011 | Johns

The Flash | #1-29 | 2011-2014 | Manapul, Buccellato

*The Flash (Rebirth)* | #1-ongoing | 2016-2017 | Williamson

1: Everyone will rightfully tell you about *Waid’s* run being the best but if you can find the single issues, it’s worth it to check out Mike Baron and William Messner-Loebs runs since you see the full extent of Wally’s character development.

### Wonder Woman

> [Definitive Wonder Woman Collecting Guide and Reading Order](https://crushingkrisis.com/crushing-comics-guide-collecting-dc-comic-books/wonder-woman-collecting-guide-trade-reading-order/#wonder-woman-1987).

5: *The omnibus by Perez*

*Rucka's run* is starting to be reprinted this month

Simone's run is OOP but comes after Rucka's and can be bought on Comixology

New 52 Volumes 1-6 then skip straight to *Rebirth*

Legend of Wonder Woman

Earth One

2: Everything Rucka is a good start

---

> [Good feminist DC comics for birthday present?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/9c8uo4/good_feminist_dc_comics_for_birthday_present/) Wonder Woman seems to have a lot of hit or miss depending on the run itself but she did like wonder woman’s Down to Earth by Greg Rucka. - 
>
> 8: If you want something intellectually feminist, it's a little counter-intuitive, but some of the older WW stuff might be more interesting than the new. Obviously the book is more aware and politically correct now (because of the time), but it's in exchange for when it was actually pretty radical and progressive.
>
> While I don't mean the original bondage-heavy comics (which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?), but for instance the Perez run (1986). This is actually the genesis of 'modern' WW as most people know her. Perez is highly credited by Patty Jenkins for inspiration for the movie (his name is credited 2nd only to Marston). He also had an influential female editor (Karen Berger), and it set the tone for a lot of her ongoing themes: for instance Rucka's embassy-based run (which you mention) was echoing Perez's diplomatic mission from Themyscira to the UN. There's also an issue that presents basically an academic deconstruction of the Pandora myth (as period Greek anti-feminism) in comic form.
>
> Going back to Marston, if she'd *like* the kinkier aspects of that transgressive history of the character, you might also look for Wonder Woman: Earth One by Grant Morrison. These are graphic novels so there's less difficulty collecting trades and making sure you don't miss things, but they essentially re-interpret some of those WMM-era sexual politics with beautiful modern art.
>
> > > which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?
> >
> > They've been reprinted in [Wonder Woman: The Golden Age](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401274447/), with volume 2 coming out [in December.](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401285368/)
> >
> > And I second the Perez recommendation, what I've read of his Wonder Woman is great.
>
> 4: Wonder Woman by Azzarello, Rucka, Simone, and Morrison. Mera got a book not too long ago. Birds of Prey by Simone. Renee Montoya as the Question. Batwoman Elergy or vol 1-4 of the new 52. Not exactly feminist, but Harley Quinn Mad Love, the Kesel run (heh, star wars) or the new 52 title.
>
> 2: My favorites are Wonder Woman (Rucka, Simone, and Azzarello are all great in different ways), Batwoman (the first set of books, by Williams), and anything with a good Lois. The Stephanie Brown Batgirl run is also good in that you get to see both Steph taking on Batgirl and Babs grappling with her role as unwilling mentor.
>
> 1: Wonder Woman Earth One by Grant Morrison and Yannick Paquette. Feminist in a ridiculously radical way imo. The art is absolutely gorgeous though.

---

9: So with her if you are just starting out at as a reader, I recommend the Rebirth Run by Greg Rucka. It even has a Year One Origin Story, and that will give you a good idea of where she’s at in the present day.

So if you are okay with skipping around and reading some past runs, I recommend the *Runs by George Perez*, Greg Rucka’s first run (he had two, one from rebirth and one from the mid 2000’s), and Gail Simone’s Run.

*George Perez’s Wonder Woman Run* is the definitive WW Run, all of the important aspects of Wonder Woman were basically developed here.

If you still want to read more, I would say catch up with her Run Rucka Rebirth Run, it’s on issue 77 I think?

Lastly, Brian Azzarello’s Run from the New 52 is pretty good, it has its problems imo, but I think it reads fine on its own.

1: If you are after the Classic-feel and understanding of the character: You should read the *George Perez-relaunch* from 1986 because it defines the character as she is today, everything everyone else does is measured against that run.

Other good runs in this classic era includes the *first run by Greg Rucka* and arguably that of Gail Simone (though it is rather light). There are also certain one-off stories that may be good to start on: The Heiketia (also by Rucka), League of One, and Who is Wonder Woman are all worth checking out.

Then you have the reboot from 2011, Wonder Woman was reset a little harder than the other big names of DC, but if you are into a book with more of a horror bent than traditional superhero action, the Azzarello run should be on your reading list. (I maintain it was one of the best written books of the New 52 that had a definitive beginning, middle and end that wasn't derailed by what other people were doing).
*Rucka's Rebirth* story is also well written, but I would honestly stick with the Year One story, the Lies wasn't that good because it just felt more like Rucka doing a reintroduction of the characters he created and used in his first run, while basically flushing out what everyone else had done in between (for better or worse).

---

So, this is going to be not a very short list, since I tend to mention a lot of stuff (though it's still considerably shorter than a Superman or Batman list). I'll start with a complete look into all the recommended stuff, with comments on which ones are good starting points.

- *Wonder Woman by Perez* - This is a classic run, a favourite for many. It was where I started reading WW. It is a good introduction to the character and the lore. However since you're new, you might not care for the old style, due to which you can leave this for later.
- *Wonder Woman by Rucka (1st run)* - This is the best WW run according to many. Highly recommended. Good entry point.
- Wonder Woman by Azzarello - This one is a bit divisive, since there are quite a few changes to the character and the lore. I like to think of it as an alternate take on the character rather than a main universe one.
- *Wonder Woman (Rebirth) by Rucka* - This is probably the best starting point. Very well received.
- Wonder Woman by Simone - Another really good Wonder Woman run.
- Wonder Woman by Jimenez - This is not as well-known as the other runs, but it has some fun stuff. Check it out later if you need more of WW.
- Legend of Wonder Woman - I haven't read it but I've heard really good things.
- JLA: A League of One - This one might sound like a JL story but is more of a Wonder Woman story.

TL;DR - Start with Rebirth. After that check out any of Rucka, Perez, Simone or Azzarello, and then other stuff

## Comic books of the most popular franchises - best books and where to start

### Blade Runner

Among the comics on Blader Runner official is only [Blade Runner 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45033606-blade-runner-2019-vol-1?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4ZNCpNkBS0&rank=1) and it is good.

### Doctor Who

Q: I wanna start reading doctor who comics But I don't know where should I start I mean what's the right order of the comics And where can I find it? 

A (by [LegoK9](https://www.reddit.com/user/LegoK9/)):

> I mean what's the right order of the comics

There are like, a dozen or so Doctor Who comic series by half a dozen publishers.

The most recommended are [Doctor Who Magazine](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine_graphic_novels) and [Titan Comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/85stpi/titan_comics_doctor_who_series_miniseries_and).

Just pick a Doctor you like and start at the beginning of (one of) their runs.

---

3 (LegoK9): *The Weeping Angels of Mons*

2: I’ve only read a few but I really liked the Star Trek Next Generation crossover. Has there been any other Doctor Who crossovers?

2: My favorite is [Abslom Daak](https://i.imgur.com/U90NSRH.jpg), but it may be hard to find a copy now, unfortunately.

2: As [/u/LegoK9](https://www.reddit.com/u/LegoK9/) says, Titan's Tenth Doctor tale *The Weeping Angels of Mons* is almost certainly the best short arc that they have produced so far - and is available as a graphic novel.

Other than that, both *Year One* and *Year Two* of their *Eleventh Doctor* run (volume 1 - 6, I think) are extremely good - and work best (especially Year Two) read as a straight run through - single issues will just be confusing.

Their Third Doctor mini-series *The Heralds of Destruction* is also great fun, and the Ninth Doctor mini-series *Weapons of Past Destruction* is also very true to this team's TV appearances.

Looking back to IDW, before them, both *Prisoners of Time* and *The Forgotten* are enjoyable.

Then there are the Panini comics from Doctor Who Magazine - where the entire Eighth Doctor run is a very good one. These are collected into four volumes: *Endgame*, *The Glorious Dead*,*Oblivion* and *The Flood*. I'm not sure about the availability of all of these - I think that *The Flood* was out of print at one point - but may be found on ebay etc.

> All of the Panini graphic novels are still in print.
>
> They can still be purchased directly from Amazon and Book Depository.

---

12: There have been loads over the years.

At the moment, **Titan** have the license for actual comics and are producing some excellent material in general:

- The Eleventh Doctor - *the first two years* of this have been brilliant - arguably better than S6 and 7 on TV, and I'd recommend them to anyone. We are now into the third year, which isn't quite on the same level, but is still interesting.
- The Twelfth Doctor - had some great arcs in *Year One*, and hit a real high point in the first half of *Year Two*. Has been a little more patchy since, but still generally very good - and the current arc is looking excellent.
- The Tenth Doctor - The highpoint so far is the *Weeping Angels of Mons* arc - outstanding, and probably best use of the Angels since *Blink*. Otherwise, the tales have been above average and pretty enjoyable overall.
- The Ninth Doctor - started with an excellent miniseries, which really caught the spirit and characterization of all the characters involved. Then became an ongoing series and has been generally good, but perhaps the most patchy of their ongoing series overall.
- Torchwood - more style than substance, and fairly slow moving as a result. Interesting, but not outstanding.

They have also done a number of miniseries for some of the Doctors - *The Eight Doctor* was a bit wishy-washy, *The Fourth Doctor* was very well characterized, but a mediocre plot, and the *Third Doctor* was brilliant.

And then there are their 'event' series, which have been mediocre at best, and gernally disappointing.

Besides **Titan**, the other line that is still ongoing is the comic strip in **Doctor Who Magazine**, which is giving us some great material for the *Twelfth Doctor* overall, but probably peaked with it's long *Eighth Doctor run* - collected into TPB's which can be difficult to find, but are worth it.

Historically the early comic strips for the first two Doctors - published in the Polystyle group of comics/magazines are really only curiosities for completists, but some of the later Third Doctor strips are really quite excellent in artwork and plot, and can rival the TV tales of the time. However the Fourth Doctor tales rapidly went downhill again, until they moved to DWM.

Prior to Titan, IDW had the licence for comics and produced a few good miniseries such as *The Forgotten* and *Prisoners of Time* which are well worth hunting out, but otherwise did not hit the same league as the current Titan tales.

> 3: Without giving it away, I do like how 10 worked out how to beat the Angels. I did like 11's story arc with Daak.

5: Yes.

The question is....which ones though?

Personally I would recommend the panini graphic novel collections. The **doctor who magazine** comic strip is for me the best doctor who comic form which all other series hope to live up to. And they have a natural advantage- a much closer connection to the BBC, and by being one part of a magazine, the comic doesn't need to always e trying any gimmicks to bring people in, it's enough that it's enjoyable.

Recommended reading- 5th doctor, *tides of time*, 6th doctor *voyager* and *the world shapers*, *all the eighth doctor* strips, tenth doctor *Crimson hand*, and *all the eleventh doctor* books.

These are the arcs where the comic really came into its own, deciding to create their own story arcs without focusing on what is happening in the tv series, or in other words, leading with great stories, instead of trying to follow what others are doing.

As for the other series, IDW is all right, but never really grabbed me (seemed to have too much continuity references for their own sake- I remember one author trying to make his story appealing by finally having the fifth doctor meet the juddoon) and **Titan** seems to be having the same issues, particularly with their multi doctor events. I really enjoy the *weeping angel of mons* (tenth doctor series) as it made me realize how we never saw the angels again in the same way we did in blink (when they returned with the eleventh doctor they were the mad killers, not those who killed with kindness by sending people back), and subsequently we had not seen the doctor face those angels directly. Also like the fourth doctor series, eyes of the medusa, as it seemed a good attempt to show the sort f story the fourth doctor would have had in television, whereas the third doctor series was clearly the sort of story a fan would write occurring between the series but would have never had appeared on television.

3: Well, *The World-Shapers* was directly referenced twice in *World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls.* It was also written by Grant Morrison.

Colin Baker even wrote a graphic novel himself. For the **DW Magazine** comics, I don't know how many of them are considered worth the time/money, but as an artifact of the series' past and something more permanent to fans from that era than the TV show was (VHS copies of the episodes didn't start coming out til 1983 and came out 1-5 per year til after the show was cancelled), I'd say they're worth a look.

2: I've not read many but those I have read have been generally very good, although aimed more at hardcore fans than casual viewers, as they often feature and expand on sub plots and tertiary characters from the tv series. I just finished reading the 12 issue series "*Prisoners of time*", which was released for the 50th anniversary and I have to say, as a fan of both classic and new who, it was excellent and I would highly recommend.

1: The Titan miniseries (*3*,*4* and *8*) are good, *11th Doc* is consistently good, 10th is eh with a few good arcs here and there and I can't speak for 9 or 12. The IDW comics can be hit or miss. For sure I'd recommend Titan's *11th Doctor*.

---

5: I'm not really a fan of **IDW**'s Tenth Doctor comics. I prefer **Titan**'s and **Doctor Who Magazine**'s a lot more. I think it's mostly to do with the art style for me, though I'm also a big fan of the other comic lines' stories.

You have a few options for Tenth Doctor comics

- DWM: The Betrothal of Sontar - 10/Rose
- IDW: Doctor Who (2008) - 10/Martha

I loved his later two DWM graphic novels, and his current run with Titan Comics is pretty great as well.

8: In modern day, there's basically three big groups of comic publishers: **IDW**, **Panini**, and **Titan**. You can get an overview of each from [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_comic_stories).

**IDW** no longer does Doctor Who comics, but they had a Tenth and Eleventh Doctor series, as well as several special stories. You can find more information [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/IDW_Publishing).

Panini is the company publishing the comics featured in **DWM**. [There was a fantastic comment on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/5lqgcl/big_finish_doom_coalition_4_trailer/dc0apsj/) that gives you all the info you would need about them, and how they're organized.

**Titan** also currently publishes their own comics, featuring Doctor Who. They currently publish Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Doctor comics, and have published Third, Fourth, and Eighth Doctor comics in the past. These are ongoing series, and are currently being published as I type. Additionally, Titan has published several other comics, including Torchwood comics, Ghost Stories (featuring the Ghost from *The Return of Doctor Mysterio*) and Summer Special comic events. You can find more information [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Titan_Publishing_Group).

Personally, the Titan stuff is fairly easy to find and digest, and is split up pretty well. The Panini stuff has some great artwork, but it can be a bit dense, and it's more expensive than the Titan stuff, generally. If you're looking for a good place to start, try starting with Titan, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

> 2: I highly recommend the *Eleventh Doctor's run* at Titan. I haven't kept up but the first 4 or 5 volumes were great! The art work is... not everyone's cup of tea but I don't mind because it fit sand flows and the story is interesting.
>
> They're all good, different from one another, but just wanted to give a heads up on 11's art styling, which I've heard complaints on.
>
> 2: On top of above suggestions, give *The Weeping Angels of Mons* a read. It's a fantastic Weeping Angel story in the 10th Doctor's run.

6: You can get the **DWM** and **Titan** graphic novels for reasonable prices from Amazon, Book Depository, and Abe Books.

2: The best comics are the **DWM** ones. The entire *8th doctor run* is a must read along with *Voyager*, Tides of Time and all the 4th doctor ones.

2: The first comic to get me into Doctor Who comics was "Doctor Who Classics" and I still haven't read much more. Iron Legion is just gripping and goofy and perfect 4th.

---

7: Long post sorry but tried to make this as comprehensive as I could for the different publishers and what to expect from each:

**Doctor Who Magazine Comics**

The longest running of Doctor Who comics and probably the most consistent of the major publishers. Forming a single series across the Doctors, it does build its own lore over the years but has plenty of jumping on points and you can start with any Doctor you want, I'll list the major jumping on points though. All of the TPBs are still in print and are easy to get ahold of at a decent price.

*The beginning* - Starting at the start with Tom Baker's first volume isn't a bad choice. You have some very good early strips by acclaimed 2000AD writers and they really capture Tom Baker's Doctor in a way I feel a lot of more recent 4th Doctor stories don't quite.

*Steve Parkhouse's run* - Parkhouse was one of the longest serving DWM writers and a very good comic writer in general. Starting with the 4th Doctor strip "The Deal", collected in the second 4th Doctor volume, Parkhouse builds a run across the 4th, 5th and 6th Doctor that's accessible enough to jump on board with any Doctor but more narratively satisfying to follow from the start as he builds on his own lore and narrative themes across his run. Parkhouse's run is among the most held up Doctor Who comics and both Tides of Time and Voyager are 2 of the highest rates stories by fans.

*post-Parkhouse* - Parkhouse leaves half way through the 6th Doctor's first collected volume and the writing keeps rotating between different creators through the 6th and 7th Doctors eras. The 6th Doctor still has a few stand outs in this time following on from Parkhouse, The World Shapers story by Grant Morrison in particular is very popular and was explicitly referenced in the s10 finale. But DWM lose their way a bit in early 7th Doctor stories. They're not bad stories, just a bit directionless and tonally light. After a few years though DWM editorial themselves feel they could be doing more and work hard to use their stable of varied writers to their strength and try to build a varied series of stories that for the first time reflect the show and move between light and heavy stories. Jumping ahead to the v2 or v3 for the 7th Doctor isn't a bad idea if you're not as willing to sit through a lot of light hearted strips that never really build up much momentum. As of v5 the 7th Doctor comics do start to use book companion Benny but the stories are still accessible enough not knowing her (and if you want her introduction you can stand alone read Love and War or listen to the BF adaptation and it's a great story).

*8th Doctor's run* - It's debatable whether this or Parkhouse's run is the more iconic of the DWM runs. Great series of stories that builds its own ongoing story for the 8th Doctor, definitely start at the start with v1 for the most rewarding experience. Writing was shared between Alan Barnes and Scott Gray early on before Scott Gray becomes the single writer for the series. Alan Barnes stories are strong, but Gray's are the highlight and I confess Barnes' characterisation for companion Izzy never really worked for me but she grew on me in leaps and bounds once Gray really took over. These stories were also a huge influence on the new show, RTD was a big fan and he lifted more than one idea for his era of the show. Most nuWho finales in RTD's time as showrunner are influenced by this run to varying levels.

*nuWho Doctors* - DWM had a lot of creative freedom even before the wilderness years, there was never much pressure or rules placed on them to be like the show and they never really were because of that. With the return of the show though DWM had to get much more in line with whatever was on TV, so more than any other era nuWho Doctors are the most accessible of DWM's comics. I'm only part way through the 10th Doctor's run so I can't speak with much insight but there are some cool stories in here, some of which became the basis of TV stories, and although he stepped away for a few years into the role of just editing the comic Scott Gray has come back to do some very well received stories for the 11th and 12th Doctors.

**IDW Comics**

IDW opened the license with a couple of years of mini-series and one shots for the 10th Doctor, the only one of which I'd significantly recommend is The Whispering Gallery one-shot.

After initial success they launched a Doctor Who ongoing starring the 10th Doctor, it's very continuity heavy pulling tonnes of classic and even Big Finish references making itself difficult for more casual fans and not particularly good either.

IDW opened the 11th Doctor's era with a relaunch from issue #1, this new ongoing was the same writer that had handled the 10th Doctor's run, but his writing is much improved, towards the end of v2 the writer changes which also gives a boost in quality.

IDW had a second relaunch during the 11th Doctor's era and v3 is probably the strongest ongoing IDW did with the license.

IDW also put out a few mini-series during the 11th Doctor's run. Most memorable an 11th Doctor Star Trek TNG crossover and the 50th anniversary *Prisoners of Time* with a single issue for each Doctor, in both cases YMMV.

Overall while IDW have their moments, and their 11th Doctor run was consistently enjoyable, they have the weakest output with the license of the 3 significant publishers. Titan collected all the IDW stuff except the Star Trek crossover into 3 trades called Archives if you want to give a look though, I recommend jumping straight to the 11th Doctor stuff if you do.

**Titan Comics**

Titan are the biggest mixed bag of the publishers and they also flood the market compared to the others so they can be a bit more overwhelming. I'll break them down by Doctor.

*Classic Doctor Mini-Series* - So far there's been tree mini series for classic Doctors, the easy stand out for most being Paul Cornell's Third Doctor mini series that tells an engaging story of its own while being a hugely nostalgic era celebration of the *3rd Doctor* and Cornell's writing farewell to Doctor Who (before he backpedaled slightly tempted back by the new Target books). There's also the 4th and 8th Doctor mini-series, neither is stand out in the way the *3rd Doctor's mini-series* but both decent reads. I personally enjoy the 8th Doctor's more of the two.

*9th Doctor Series* - Comprised of a mini-series followed by a single ongoing, got off to a decent start but never really has much in the way of stand out stories and I find I liked it less as it went on and it didn't seem to capture anyone as their favourite.

*10th Doctor Series* - 3 ongoing series separated into "Years" that operate like separate seasons of the show. Builds a new journey for the 10th Doctor with a new set of companions set during his specials year. The stories are a bit hit and miss but rarely bad and it does very good long running character work across the run with good companion growth and engaging characters. The "season finale" type stories do tend to be a bit messy and dense, I find them usually the weakest part of the 10th Doctor stuff so don't be too put off if you have fun but don't like a finale, it's worth carrying on if you've enjoyed it up to then.

*11th Doctor Series* - The easy stand out of Titans output IMO. Similar to the 10th Doctor, split into "Years" each like its own season and builds its own era with new companions set between s5 and s6. *11th Doctor* stuff isn't just good Doctor Who stories but genuinely good comics in general. Some of the biggest current talent in comics worked on this and put out some really experimental and impressive stories. Strong characterisation of the Doctor and original companions, strong stories some of which really experiment with the comic medium and really adds to the shows lore in a way I feel genuinely adds to what we saw on screen with the 11th Doctor.

*12th Doctor Series* - The most inconsistent of Titan's output, most likely in part down to a lack of freedom and writers lack of familiarity with the era having to write for it as it's unfolding. Follows a "Year" format once again, but the splitting points feel a bit more arbitrary since it's always structured around changes in the show that don't line up with the relaunches. At its best it's better than the 9th Doctor series, at its worst it's Titans worst output. I'd advise skipping to Year Two if you want to give it a go and I feel Year Two and Three are mostly fun engaging stories but it does have a weak showing at the end when a new writer comes on board at the same time Bill does.

*Yearly Multi-Doctor Events* - These are of very variable quality, none of them are great but to different degrees they can be fun very fannish reads depending on if that's your thing. They use original Titan companions travelling with the Doctors but each Doctor ongoing is totally stand alone from these so they're a totally optional read and not reflective of Titan's usual quality.

Titan are also building up to a new direction to coincide with Whittaker's era. The 10th and 11th Doctors are getting fresh ongoings with totally new directions and a new 13th Doctor ongoing with one of Titan's best artists and a new writer. There's also the recently announced "Road to the Thirteenth Doctor" one shots for Doctors 10, 11 and 12 that'll lead up to Whittaker's debut, but I'm cautious about them as they're all written by the worst writer Titan have.

5: If you're a New Series fan, check out Titan's stuff. The *Tenth Doctor* and *Eleventh Doctor* stuff is generally really strong, and the Ninth and Twelfth Doctor stuff have their moments. They're a bit easier to get into, and while artwork can sometimes be wonky as hell (I don't think anyone has been able to do a good Eleventh Doctor from what I've read so far), the stories are mostly good.

If you're interested in the Classic Series, Panini (the publishers of Doctor Who Magazine) have been collecting old comics into graphic novels. These feature the Fourth Doctor on, and have work by some pretty big people (Dave Gibbons, the artist for Watchmen, did the artwork for most of the Fourth Doctor's run and the first story of Five's run, Andrew Cartmel wrote for Seven, and Rob Shearman wrote for Nine). Those comica are generally really high quality, with generally great artwork and strong stories. They're a bit more mature than Titan's stuff (not a dig at all), and as such, they can be a bit heavy, so be aware of that.

There's a lot of earlier comics, but those are harder to come by, and there's also IDW, who did some Ten and Eleven comics in the late 2000s and early 2010s, but I'm not as familiar with those, honestly, so I can't in good conscience make a recommendation there either way.

5 (by LegoK9): The current run of Doctor Who comics by Titan comics are high quality and very accessible for modern fans. I highly recommend *The Weeping Angels of Mons*.

Titan has main series for Doctors 9-12 and miniseries for 3, 4, and 8. A series for 13 and a miniseries for 7 come out this year.

There are also three multi-Doctor crossover stories.

[Here's my visual guide for how the crossovers fit in each Doctor's timeline,](https://i.imgur.com/DLGJVaz.jpg) but they aren't essential reading for the main plots.

2: Titan. They're like new who done in the serial format of old who. They expand the source material in various ways, and they have a ninth doctor mini.

1: if you like *The Sandman*, then track down Steve Parkhouse's early '80's work. they have some stylistic similarities to that period Gaiman.

> Or where is a good place to start for someone who hasn't gotten into the Who universe beyond the show?

as with the television series, you really do not have to know anything. you already know the basics.

### Judge Dredd

16: Dredd is unfortunately even worse than Marvel and DC because he's got one unbroken continuity for 30some years, over 2100 "progs" (issues, I believe usually 6 pages every week), he ages in real time, and constantly references events that happened decades ago. In recent issues he's still dealing with fallout from the Apocalypse War, which happened in the 80s.

If you really want to just get right into it, I would suggest buying the *Complete Case Files #1* and going from there. I'd love to pick up all those Mega Collection books but I can only image how expensive that'd be here in Canada. If you're from the UK, and you can find them for a decent price, have at it.

I think basically the best advice with ANY character is just jump in wherever you want, and know that you might have to look a few things up. As people have mentioned, Apocalypse War and the Cursed Earth Saga are great old runs (with the Apocalypse War being a constant major theme throughout his entire history), *Origins* and *America* are excellent "middle years" stories, and the three Day of Chaos books and Titan are good modern day stories. Understand that early Dredd is very silly, but it's a sci-fi comic, so that's expected. It becomes a little more "grounded" later on, as much as it can/should, but you'll find that most of the case files books or other collections do a good job of having contained stories that can be enjoyed on their own.

8: Been re-reading the entirety of Dredd over the past few years as well as his spin-offs. I'd say you should go for the mega collection and start off with the following handful of books from it:

*Origins*

*America*

Brothers of the blood

The apocalypse war

Judge Death lives

The cursed earth

Psi-judge Anderson: The possessed

These books are really the foundation of Dredd. *Origins* and Brothers of the blood pretty much sum up his backstory as well as handling the world-building while *America* goes into how the citizens view the judges. They're great individually as introductory Dredd books because they just need you to understand the idea that the judges are dictators and the citizens both hate and need them and they each have great stories. Reading these will allow you to read most of the stuff in the mega collection as most of the books are filled with standalone stories built around a theme like there's one all about assassins and another about horror monsters.

If you enjoy those 3 then Apocalypse war, Judge Death lives and the cursed earth are a great next step. They all expand Dredd's world, introduce major characters that'll be important for big events set after them and they're pretty solid standalone reads.

The Anderson book collects her first handful of solo stories. There's some amazing work here with great writing and some of the best art I've seen from comics but the main reason to read this after the others I mentioned is that she plays big roles in a lot of major stories like Necropolis and Judgement on Gotham set later on so it's worth knowing the character a bit.

Dredd can seem like an intimidating comic series to get into because of how long it's been running but all you really need to get into any of his books is a Wikipedia summary of what the franchise is about. After that he's pretty simple.

<u>I'd say avoid the case files</u>. I've tried reading them and they're just not as enjoyable to read due to the production quality. The paper in the mega collection feels so much better than the old newspaper stuff in the case files, the binding is better since the pages are sewn to the spine in the same way as a marvel omnibus which just makes it so comfy to read compared to the files where they're glued into the spine. Lastly, and maybe it's not really an advantage depending on opinion but Dredd hasn't always put out winners and the case files start from issue 1 and go through everything so you have to deal with filler and straight-up bad stories while <u>the collection tends to leave the really bad and irrelevant stuff out</u>.

Good luck getting into the character, hope you enjoy him since I always want to see more Dredd fans. Feel free to shoot me a message if you want to ask any further questions.

6: *Case Files 5* is a good starting point. Contains *Blockmania* and *The Apocalypse War*.

For modern Dredd, id go for *America*, *Origins* or Mandroid.

Edit: or Titan. Titan was great!

4: The Complete Case Files are perfect. If you don't want to start at #1 I'd go with *#5*. This contains *Blockmania* and *The Apocalypse War* which are the perfect go to at any point in Dredds history.

2: Agreed on *Case Files vol. 5*, and on "*America*"--both stone classics.

I also really love "Trifecta," which does a lot less hand-holding up front--you'll probably be baffled at first if you're going in cold--but is eventually pretty clear, and is also a fantastic story.

1: STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING IDW HAS DONE WITH DREDD. It's all completely awful, trust me. Keep it to 2000AD.

Start with Case Files #1 and go from there.

---

10: Here's a video for ya mate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yUwX1rR-zc

> *Case Files vol. 1*, *Case Files vol. 5*, *America*.

5: I just started recently myself and after looking into a bit it seemed like the recommendations were either to start at the beginning if you're a completionist or jump to *complete case files 05* that has a few iconic stories. I picked up *complete case files 05* and am enjoying it so far but I still have a ways to go with it. So far none of it really felt like I jumped into a story halfway through. Other recommendations were either *America* or *Origins* but I haven't read them yet so hopefully someone else can weigh in.

Most of the stories I've read seem to be stand alone cases though, sort of like a police procedural like law & order except the stories take place in a sci-fi future and the police, lawyers, and judges are all rolled up into completely over the top fascist super cops. 

> 9: *Case Files 05* has *Block Mania*, *The Apocalypse War* and The Dark Judges in it. it's an absolutely brilliant introduction to the character and features some of the most iconic early stories.
>
> *America* is fantastic and one of the best Dredd stories ever written, but it definitely doesn't paint Dredd and the whole Judges system in a very good light.

2: [*Judge Dredd: America*](http://www.amazon.com/Judge-Dredd-America-John-Wagner/dp/1781083703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439796591&sr=8-1&keywords=judge+dredd+america) is often considered the best Judge Dredd story, and it just got reprinted in trade paperback!

---

I get asked "where do I start with *Judge Dredd*?" rather a lot. My short answer: Of the books that are currently in print in the U.S., **you're going to want to start** with [*Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files 05*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781080283/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1781080283). That's right: volume 5. It's a very solid introduction; you won't need any information from the earlier volumes that it won't give you, and you can always go back and read those volumes later if you want. It's a big fat black-and-white paperback with a year's worth of weekly stories, circa 1981-1982, including (among others) three very fondly remembered serials: "Judge Death Lives" (drawn by Brian Bolland), "Block Mania" and "The Apocalypse War" (drawn by Dredd's co-creator Carlos Ezquerra).

The **best introduction** to *Judge Dredd* is probably *America*, a collection of three stories by John Wagner and Colin MacNeil (from 1990, 1996 and 2006) that made the series much more interestingly complicated. It's finally back in print--in the U.K., not the U.S.--but there's [a Kindle edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905437587/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1905437587&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20) of it that's available in the U.S., too. (There's also an argument that a lot of the drama of *America* comes from its reversal of what had come before it; I still think it's a terrific place to start.)

The **most recent material that's been collected** is [Judge Dredd: Tour of Duty - Mega-City Justice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907992391/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1907992391)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/MR47EhB5RE0Aif-KjwDTlxHTKG_QP8D84XNJEakZN1PVGOGcIPsdJF5Q2PqzUhLMIS50IYKhgGB6KKFmnprvM8Ly7NmgDBFWi9vOyTj02TEmmOtNiHXqmMw=s0-d) , which collects a pretty terrific 2009-2010 serial. It's a British book, though, and effectively the second half of a long storyline (the first half has been collected as [Judge Dredd: Tour of Duty - The Backlash](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907519238/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1907519238)![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/EJaB25eqApk62yFERfGNPqT6r8rP4f0PCibwSY7VSn8AJB1eA3P5bTx4ee_1QywD9_YXgCa0fFpU1b4H7r6VKip410MFGO34r1bKmAcjBXCQpgJdIOlnO1I=s0-d)). (UPDATE: As of this writing, the most recent U.K. material to be collected is the terrific [Judge Dredd: Trifecta](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQBW&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RRCyWsL8tTF4Wy3VGYjL2nwMFUxGaxCCJZ0WXihosypGPVRvpFXkgphQsrWzrnr-G_fVW7l2W8DZ0pUQCJZqy-aTihmnnw0V6oP-46Yl6xk08Y2iGAYNrjV97k6K0A=s0-d).)

The **most recent long storyline** in the weekly *2000 AD* comics was "Day of Chaos," an excellent, very densely packed thriller that ran for an entire year, from *2000 AD* #1740 to 1789. It hasn't yet been collected, and it's the payoff for several years' worth of buildup. You can, however, buy the whole thing issue-by-issue, in physical or digital form, from [2000 AD's site](http://shop.2000adonline.com/). (UPDATE: It's now available in two volumes: [Judge Dredd Day Of Chaos: The Fourth Faction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQC6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQC6&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WwQ9p4xg7oCWPB0yRzSNVTdL06S181wNjy2bJXDjpZi9DKXuZFZaOxLcgR2-tCLDzQ6UFrW0YCfaelWUx4PxoV8CdNkDmcbPK27VP21C3K-iouX6S401ISgcFmE7Kw=s0-d) and [Judge Dredd Day Of Chaos: Endgame](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQDA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQDA&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/xXVjjED8MxN8XGq6n3QPtAeDOytiJZvzHpa-bfZRv7g8Nb72ZbX92-SSXLgFJqbhEW_rJpbm4xN0WRee6NH7F9qyqHtLl7fkm7o_rxczVvL0PWvz8kN8mHEoR-9fnw=s0-d).)

Is there a **story from which \*Dredd\*-the-movie was adapted**? No, there isn't. (From what I can tell, the movie effectively takes place a little while before the beginning of the comics series.) However, Olivia Thirlby's character Cassandra Anderson makes one of her memorable early appearances in "Judge Death Lives," in the aforementioned [*Complete Case Files 05*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781080283/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1781080283)![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/kXChuX5clDhQ3B32xjQim96iT5a3SgVCspL0jrKtfZKK4twADGRId96MXAyeLnGHDU-dRM6TDCvWgwn2LAHeSGQJ9YO6kOuol7iDbrXeLaiFl18Uk-uVkeA=s0-d). (UPDATE: There is, however, a one-shot comic book sequel to the movie that's also available in digital form: [Dredd: Underbelly](http://shop.2000adonline.com/products/digital_dredd_underbelly).)

If you want to **read everything in order**, there's always the blog you're looking at right now: I'm writing about all the non-redundant collections of *Dredd* comics in the publication order of the first story they include that hasn't already been covered (with a few exceptions). There are a lot of them--counting spinoffs with the same setting, there are currently about 75 volumes' worth of material, and that's not counting the hundreds of episodes that haven't yet been reprinted. 


And the **best books**? The general favorites among fans are everything named above, as well as the British collection [Complete Case Files 14](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906735298/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1906735298)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Z06k0vMg-2IK7jpN-nNxTYHty3isz61mH5Oab40CA1Xeizky-KO1uQlfDjhhGGcummV_q0HQzaV_KiG6R2dEJ6tA3VpDV7Z2fDDFplTUsG2BZEemw_KVRLo=s0-d), which collects the "Necropolis" storyline (and serves as the payoff to another few years' worth of stories). My personal faves also include *Brothers of the Blood* and the spinoffs *Chopper: Surf's Up*, *Mega-City Undercover Vol. 02: Living the Low Life*, *The Taxidermist* and [Devlin Waugh: Red Tide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904265294/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1904265294&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/2bFMeb0RWp7zJyJoLLzhPl3J7FptyA2aer4BE3_dQLUKKBEhw8kxN4dCFHeEt3JdUHDkO544Qh8HgYIzmcuaE64S8o_PZzs5B6Dzhfu4ywg3j-Cw9BN4QUSiOyzyUA=s0-d).)

### Rick and Morty

People say all Rick and Morty comics are good. At least that's what they say about the main run.

### Silent Hill

> Are all the Silent Hill comics garbage?

10: *Past Life* and *Downpour: Anne's Story* are very good out of the ones I've read.

> 5: Those were great. I enjoyed Sinner's Reward, too. The art in Past Life is just amazing. Of course, I am a Menton3 fangirl.

3: The ones released in the early 2000's I've heard were not very good, but I've never read them so idk. The ones Tom Waltz has written are pretty good. Sinner's Reward is my personal favorite, but I liked the *Downpour* comics too.

---

5: *Anne's Story* and *Past Life* are the best comics in the Silent Hill series. Anne's story is the Downpour DLC we never got and Past Life connects to Downpour as well and has amazing artwork. All the other comics are pretty terrible. I really wish we could have gotten those Japanese mobile comics by Ito :(

> 1: This is the correct answer.
>
> Also, there is one crazy short Ito comic available here: http://www.silenthillmemories.net/publications/sh_white_hunter_en.htm
>
> The best bet for Silent Hill fans would be to read Junji Ito's work. It contains the same feeling, but in independent short stories of cosmic horror madness. https://junji-ito-index.tumblr.com/the-index

3: I'm currently reading Silent Hill 2's official novelization.

Gives the story a whole new dimension.

100% recommended!

---

8: They’re not generally well received, check out Linkara Atop The 4th Wall. He reviewed them a while back

7: *Past Life* was good and there was at least one more that was good, and everything else was laughably bad.

7: Fun fact - there are two comics made by Team Silent members - Hiroyuki Owaku and Masahiro Ito.

1. Cage of Cradle - it's about Lisa and her boyfriend.
2. Double Under Dusk - it's about father who loses his son. However, they were made for Japanese market only :(

### Star Trek

3: Peter David's work is generally pretty good. I loved Who Killed Captain Kirk? when I read it way back in high school.

2: Star Trek: *Starfleet Academy*, Star Trek: Boldly Go Vol 1 & 2, Star Trek: Countdown

2: IDW series.

2: As for stuff running now, John Byrne's New Visions is both bizarre and straight out of TOS. Many others are also very good.

Marvel and DC published lots of good stuff in the 80s and 90s, though much of it takes place in the movie era. They are all available on one cd that I think you can still get on amazon. Definitely the best value.

1: I've enjoyed the Star Trek TNG Mirror Broken series. It follows the Mirror universe versions of the Next Generation crew, a fun little 'what if' series.

I also liked the first few issues of Star Trek: Waypoints. One has Geordi as the Captain with a crew of Data.

Lastly, the second Doctor Who and Star Trek crossover was pretty fun. I think [Linkara did a review if it](https://youtu.be/qbknLNB8DcM).

---

5: I don't like a good portion of the later Marvel stuff, but I *love* *STARFLEET ACADEMY*. It's under 20 issues and follows Nog at the Academy with lots of clever tie-ins to the Dominion War and classic trek. There's a really awesome two-parter that brings the cadets to Talos IV and it's pure fanboy fun with some really great characters. Bizarrely, the book's artist went on to direct THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS.

3: I would say that *Starfleet Academy* and *Early Voyages* are the two good Marvel ongoings.

> Good call! Early Voyages is also fantastic. It would be cool if one day both series get proper endings somehow.

4: It seems noone has yet mentioned Countdown, soo...

STAR TREK: COUNTDOWN! Also Star Trek: Nero and Star Trek: Spock (reflections)

---

3: The "Star Trek: Ongoing" series is pretty good in my opinion. They're the only available tie-in to the Abrams-verse timeline and they're overseen by the writers of the movies, making more canon than others.

They also did a decent job with the movie tie-in comics, the prequel and the story behind some of the deleted scenes. The actual movie adaptation was pretty bad, as is the case with most adaptations.

The only other one I've read is Hive, written by Brannon Braga. It's got one issue to go, but so far its pretty fan-fictiony and it's kind of a re-hash.

2: Hive is okay. It takes place some time after Nemesis, so no Mr. Data, Riker and Troi are married, Worf is still an ambassador, and the rest of the crew are scattered to the wind. The problem it has is the same that most Star Trek properties have: There is a need for fan service. The fans expect the original crew to get together to solve this, but they also want them frozen in amber the way they last saw them.

Personally, I am mixed about it. It would make sense for Riker, Worf and Picard to work together, but the rest of the crew have gone on with their lives and should not come back because of expectations.

As for the other series, I've heard good things about it, but I have not made room for it in my pull list.

> Dark Mirror. http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Mirror

---

3: The ones with green lantern (Star Trek/Green Lantern) were cool. Haven't really looked into them, intend to.

2: The Star Trek X-men (Star Trek/X-Men) crossovers from the 90s were both really good.

1: Most of them are not great tbh, I've read a few and the only ones I can recommend are The Enterprise Experiment, Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever, and the TNG Mirror Universe series.

The Enterprise Experiment is a sequel to the Enterprise Incident written by the TOS writer and script editor DC Fontana. It has a real feeling of a lost TOS Script adapted to a comic.

The most well-received Star Trek comics I've seen (not just among Trekkies but among comic book enthusiasts in general) are the TNG Mirror Universe series. They never touched the Mirror Universe (*Mirror Broken*) on TNG so it's fertile ground. It also shows the eventual fate of Mirror Spock. It was so well received that Eaglemoss made a model out of the Mirror Enterprise D for their collection https://shop.eaglemoss.com/usa/star-trek-starships/iss-enterprise-ncc-1701-d

Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever is an adaptation of Ellison's original script that got heavily rewritten. Opinions differ on whether it's better than the final episode, but it's certainly worth taking a look.

1: *Early Voyages*, which was basically a Captain Pike series, was pretty solid, old-school *Trek* (and even more intriguing after *Discovery*'s second season).

1: Boldy Go is really great. I couldn't put them down.

---

2: If you can get your hands on some Gold Key issues from the 60's, those are pretty interesting. But for something more reasonable, Barr and David wrote a bunch of original series and TNG comics for DC in the late 80's and early 90's that are pretty good. There's some DS9 comics from Malibu in the 90's which are ok, but I think I might just have a blind spot for anything DS9.

Over the past few years, Tipton has been writing some pretty good TNG comics. The Mirror Universe minis are especially good, *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*. Terra Incognita came after that, it was ok. The current one is The Q Conflict, and is only 1 issue in. Not sure on it yet. I've heard good things about the Discovery comics, but never bothered to pick them up.

### Star Wars

5: The best of the new canon IMO are Aphra, Poe Dameron, all the Vaders, and the older Lando miniseries. The main flagship series is middle of the road.

4: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars Legacy!

From the new canon, I liked a lot of the Vader 2015 run, Vader down especially. Haven't kept up to date with anything current though.

> 6: The new Vader run is just as good, if not better, than the 2015 version, so I'd highly recommend it. The *Doctor Aphra* series too.

4: *Knights of the Old Republic* was great fun, dramatic, and inventive. *Republic* told an excellent Quinlan Vos story across a few years and into the Clone Wars. *Agent of the Empire* was great too.

In canon, the current *Darth Vader* (I guess he means *Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*) series has been excellent. The first *Lando* mini-series is probably his best story and one of the best in canon so far, and the *Poe Dameron* series is well worth checking out.

EDIT: And the *Doctor Aphra* series has been absolutely bonkers.

3: legends: dawn of the jedi

canon: darth vader - dark lord of the sith

2: I haven't read a lot of Legends, but the best series in canon so far has been Charles Soule's Darth Vader series (*Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*). Sometimes they use the title Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith because there was already one Vader series.

---

11: [Soule's canon *Darth Vader* series](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith). Excellent story, art, and writing. Nice for newcomers.

4: Start with the Vader comics, they're by far the best of the current comic canon. There was a 2015 series set after ANH and a 2017 series set in Vaders early days. The 2017 series is the best. You can buy them in collected editions:
https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith

> 3: I agree 100%! The 2017 Vader series has easily been the best Marvel has put out, as far as Star Wars comics.

3: What are your favorite characters/settings in Star Wars right now?

Of the post-Disney comics, the two runs of Vader stories are probably the most popular (for good reason). The Lando and the Obi-Wan & Anakin miniseries are both really great, too.

From Legends, the Legacy series and the Tales of the Jedi comics are both really highly rated.

3: First off I would just like to say that all the Legends comics as well as the NEU comics (on a six month delay) are available on Marvel Unlimited

For a lot of good lists check out [r/StarWarsEU](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsEU/) or [r/starwarscanon](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarscanon/). Also are you just interested in comics or books as well? Also [r/starwars](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwars/) has some archived threads about what books to read on its FAQ.

IF you would like to check on some books your self I suggest using Wookieepedia

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Legends_comics

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_comics

I will give you some of my personal favorites.

Legends (The old canon universe up till the disney purchase in 2015)

Comics:

Tales of the Jedi (Sets the lore and history for the Jedi and Sith that the entire Legends EU would use. And that the NEU is still basing some small parts on)

*Knights of the Old Republic* (A sort of Tie-in to the game but focused on new characters. You have never read about a Jedi like Zayne Carrick before)

Star Wars Republic (The Clone Wars show before the Clone Wars show)

Rebellion/Empire (A lot of good stories mainly about Luke but staring some others as well.

Star Wars Tales (Some true and some not so true stories. Think the most recent point of view book. Also SKIPPY WAS NEVER CANON)

Legacy of the Force (While the NJO series would give some more background all you need to know is that its 137ABY and Luke's great gandson is a force using pirate with a attitude problem)

Now for the NEU/Canon

Comics:

Vader 2015/*2017* (Both Vader series are worth a read)

Poe (They are trying to make Poe and Black Squadron the Rogue Squadon of the NEU and its working. Also get to learn more about Lor San Tekka as well)

Aphra (About a rogue archeologist and her mission to steal everything in the galaxy)

Shattered Empire (Adventures with our heroes days after Endor seen though the eyes of Poe's mom)

Darth Maul (Maul killing people is fun)

Star Wars 2015 (The art is terrible, the characterization is bad, the stories are either great or medicore. But it is the main flagship comic)

Age Of miniseries (which tells stand alone stories from the main three eras of the movies)

---

10: The Obi-Wan and Anakin comic is one if my favorite, along with Poe Dameron!

7: Don't limit yourself to the canon comics! The best Star Wars comics out there are some of the older non-canon ones that were originally published by Dark Horse. They *should* all be on Marvel unlimited. My favourite on-goings were *Republic*/*Dark Times* (same series, had a name change after the story caught up to a certain infamous galactic event involving a 66th order - though, on the balance, I feel like the *Dark Times* books are better and you could totally start with them), and *Knights of the Old Republic*. There are a few shorter series or parts of on-goings that really stand out, too. Any of the *Darth Vader and the [insert subtitle]* series are great, except *...Lost Command,* which I felt was pretty weak. The final arc of *Tales of the Jedi,* which unless I'm remembering my titles wrong is called *Redemption,* is great.

Also, just as an aside, if you're in to big space adventures and you have the time to read it, check out the 2006 Marvel Cosmic event *Annihilation* - if you like Star Wars, you'd probably like it, too. [Here's a link to a reading order!](http://comicbookreadingorders.com/marvel/events/annihilation-reading-order/)

7: Lando is the best of the new comics, I think. It's an interesting, self-contained story. There aren't too many outlandish things (I'm looking at you, Poe) and it really adds a lot to Lando's character and motivations. It's really well written, and even adds something extra to ESB for me, which is quite a feat. I can't recommend it enough!

---

1: Ledgends Canon:

Tales of the Jedi (Takes place a long time ago and talks about the start of the Sith and some important Lords and Jedi Masters)

*KOTOR* (acctually focused on a different jedi and not Revan but still a great read)

Republic/The Clone Wars (focused on the era between Naboo and ep 2 then moves onto arcs dealing with the Clone Wars)

Rebellion/Empire (Stories from the Rebellion and Empire and shows a more neutral imperial view)

Legacy (Takes place 75 years after the death of Luke/Han/Leia. Lots of intersting characters and cool fights)

Smaller ones: Mara Jade emperors hand, Dark Times, X-wing, Jedi hunt.

Canon:

Star Wars (The main title detailing Han/leia/luke after Yavin)

*Darth Vader* (Enough said)

Kannan: The last padawn (Kannan dealing with the death of his master and order 66)

Shattered Empire (Lead up to TFU)

Poe Dameron (New Comic just started)

*Obi wan* & *Anakin* ( cool adventures and getting to see the two interact)

Here is a list of all comics Ledgends and Disney Canon for you to look at. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_comics

Amazon, Comixology, Dark Horse, Marvel are all great legal places to get the comics. Though if money is tight there are Kickass places to get them. Though thats Pirating them and that would be Bad

### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

6: I would start with the *IDW* comics. It's probably the best incarnation of the turtles thus far. (or at least the first 50 issues that I've read was)

3: Please take a look at our [Comic Book Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/3egxa6/official_rtmnt_comic_book_primer/). If you take a few minutes to read through the whole thing, you should be able to get a good idea what series fits your desire. But as others have said, the *IDW* series is real good. It isn't as dark as the Mirage series, but the story is far better since it has been well organized throughout its existence.

1: I would suggest one of three starting points:

If you are ready to deep dive from the beginning, go back to the Mirage Vol. 1 issues. (The first TMNT comics.) They are 80's independent comics, so they may not be to your taste. But as a big TMNT fan, it is at least worth reading the ones done by Eastman & Laird which is roughly the first 11 issues, Return to New York (three issues) and City at War. All of those stories were reprinted by IDW and should be available on comixology.

If you just want something to read and would prefer a modern take, start with *IDW's* current series. It's a fresh reboot though it does build off ideas and characters done in previous versions.

Since you specifically mentioned the 80's Turtles though, your best bet may be the Archie series. It essentially took the cartoon Turtles and then built their own world around them. *IDW* has reprinted the first 20 to 30 issues of that series as trade paperbacks as well. That's probably the easiest and cheapest way to get them.

> 3: The IDW series falls about midway between the original Mirage series and the cartoon Turtles.

---

> Where's a good place to start reading TMNT comics?

2: Comixology has the whole series!

2: If you're actually wanting to get into TMNT comics, I suggest starting with our [Comic Book Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/3egxa6/official_rtmnt_comic_book_primer/)

If you're looking for the shortest and most concise answer, I recommend starting with either:

1. The old school Mirage series (this is the true original origin of the TMNT). The first volume can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1613770073/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1497874868&sr=8-1&keywords=mirage+vol+1)
2. The first *IDW* volume. This is debatable the best iteration of the TMTN comic. Purchase link [here](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1631401114/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497874857&sr=8-1&keywords=idw+volume+1)

There are an overwhelming amount of comics for someone just starting out. Feel free to ask us any questions! The comics are phenomenal, and I think you would enjoy the comics if you're looking for a more adult-themed version of the show. IDW is my personal favorite.

> Nice!! Hope you enjoy it. In my opinion, if you start to really enjoy IDW, then pick up the Mirage collection volume 1. That's really the first main story arc. It's worth a read at some point, but the Mirage story is all over the place starting after that arc. Let us know how you like *IDW*!

1: I personally like the *IDW* collections. They are hard bound editions, full color and contain the main series and the micro series in chronological order. I went this route after trying to read them digitally and quickly learned I was not understanding the references of the micro series as they weren't included. They may be included in the Comixology, but when i downloaded the issues for Kindle, there were not.

I order the books from Amazon and they are normally below $40. They are fantastic collector pieces and are stories I turn to often. Here is a link to Vol. 1. https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1631401114/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1497846307&sr=8-3&keywords=idw+collection

The series is fantastic, you won't be disappointed.

---

> Must read TMNT runs

7: For $35, you can get [Vol. 1 (issues 1-8)](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1613770073) of the famous Mirage Studios run in hardcover. It's known for being more gritty and adult compared to the animated series.

For something more recent, try the [*IDW series*](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Volume/dp/1613771398) ($13 for issues 1-4). It's a reboot set in NYC with some interesting twists on the original world.

Happy reading!

4: Definitely read the original Mirage run (mostly, just the stuff by Eastman & Laird, found in the Ultimate Collection HC's) and *the current IDW* ongoing. For the latter, I would recommend starting at the beginning and reading all the tie-ins like the micro-series one-shots, mini-series, etc. They've really put together an excellent narrative with lots of classic elements and great new twists. Here's a pretty good [reading order](http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/showthread.php?t=36475) for the IDW stuff.

Outside of that, I haven't actually read any of Vol. 2 (also Mirage), 3 (Image), or 4 (Mirage? Done by Peter Laird). Vol. 2 is really short and I haven't heard much about it. Vol. 3 is basically considered non-canon at this point, and from what I gather runs very far afield from what was established by the original comics, cartoons, and movie. It seems like a "love it" or "hate it" sort of thing. Vol. 4 seems to have a small but very devoted fan-base, but I don't know much about that one either.

4: *City at War* (Mirage v1 #50-62) is widely viewed as the best TMNT run, it's the arc that every other arc is compared to basically. The recent *City Fall* (IDW 21-28 - Volume 3 I guess) was incredibly good as well, very comparable to City at War in terms of quality). Return to New York (Mirage v1 19-21 plus Tales of TMNT v2 70) was also a fantastic run.

2: Original Mirage volume 1 of course. Get the Ultimate Collections. Every single one of them. Brilliant stuff.

the new Eastman/Waltz run on IDW is okay, not great, though. The micro series and various miniseries (Secret History of the Foot, Utrom Empire, Turtles in Time) related to it have been extremely good, though.

Also, Tales of the TMNT volume 2, published by Mirage by various writers and artists, is something any TMNT fan can greatly appreciate. [IDW is starting to publish them in collected but I don't know how far they'll go.](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Tales-ebook/dp/B00HYIC9JQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1411233211&sr=8-3&keywords=tales+of+the+tmnt) Also, they've collected the volume 1 Tales which is cool, too. It's the first two volumes of the Tales trades.

## Best comics by literary genres

### Fantasy



### Sci-fi

#### Cyberpunk

10: It's not light-drizzle, neon-light cyberpunk, but *Transmetropolitan* is really good. I've only read the first three volumes, but from what I've read so far, it explores a lot of problems that the author has imagined for a dystopian future. Also, the protagonist is crazy af.

6: *Judge Dredd* comics, old, but still good.

5: [*Blame!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!) is what I would describe as Goth Cyberpunk, and it's story is told through minimal dialogue, major action, and one of the Largest worlds I have ever come across. It's absolutely bananas how large of a scale we are talking.

4: Drugs and Wires

> 3: http://www.drugsandwires.fail/contents/ <<link
>
> 3: Also [dreamspace](http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/) by the same artist.

3: Try Elephantmen, it's set in the future when a group tries to create super soldiers by impregnating humans with human/animal hybrid embryos. We come in when the hybrids or 'elephantmen' are integrated into human society which at this point is a dystopian cyberpunk world. I've only read the first four omnibus graphic novels but so far it's great.

3: *Hard Boiled* is Cyberpunk as fuck.

3: Just finished reading *Tokyo Ghost* by Rick Remender and Sean Murphy and that was an enjoyable read. It has a nature v. technology (or maybe communism v. capitalism?) theme that gets a bit over thew top but the world building and central characters are interesting.

2: Stuff I've read and enjoyed:

- [Chronicles of Centrum](https://www.amazon.de/Die-Chroniken-Centrum-Jean-Pierre-Andrevon/dp/3770432541) could only find german and french issues but maybe there's a translation. Also a bit short, but I like it.
- [Battle Angel Alita aka. Gunnm](https://myanimelist.net/manga/768/Gunnm) Does Manga count? This one's pretty good and also long. Love the scenario.
- [Ghost in the Shell](https://myanimelist.net/manga/1023/Koukaku_Kidoutai__The_Ghost_in_the_Shell) Haven't read it but the ratings are not bad and since the movies are based on it.

2: None of these are 100% cyberpunk, but they incorporate some elements:

Lazarus - no neon lights or hacking, but a cool low life high tech dystopian that's regressed to a feudal system. Also super soldiers with swords

Copperhead - does space western count as cyberpunk?

Descender - robots, cyborgs, civilization on the brink of collapse etc.

> Trawling through the web I came upon this little gem from CBR: [The Best Cyberpunk Comics Ever](https://www.cbr.com/the-best-cyberpunk-comics-ever/) and thought it worth the share.
>
> Note: the author points out at the beginning that Manga is excepted, as are the Neuromancer and Blade Runner adaptations, so that frees the field a little. Take a look and enjoy! Feel free to discuss, there were a few in there I’d never even heard of.

- 9/15: EMPTY ZONE
- 8/15: JUDGE DREDD: MEGA-CITY 2
- 7/15: THE PRIVATE EYE
- 6/15: 2020 VISIONS
- 5/15: 100%
- 4/15: *TOKYO GHOST*
- 3/15: *HARD BOILED*
- 2/15: *TRANSMETROPOLITAN*
- 1/15: THE LONG TOMORROW

---

7: *Transmetropolitan*.

"Sorry, no. I'm married, not hungry, infected with seven unknown diseases, gay, pregnant with lizards and clinically dead."

> 2: This - highly recommend Transmet, it's completely off the hook cyberpunk/transhumanist, the art is amazing, couldn't recommend more.

4: Ghost in the shell, Akira

2: Silent Dragon basically a yakuza revenge story in a cyberpunk setting

1: People have already said GiTS and Akira, so I'll second those and also recommend; Blame! *Origin Judge Dredd* A lot of Masamune Shirow's other work

---

10: *transmetropolitan*

> 1: I can't get enough of Blame! have you got more recommendations for similar things?

2: *Trasmetropolitan*, *Hard Boiled*, Ronin, Akira, Battle Angel Alita, *Tokyo Ghost*,

2: I think this is the third time this last two weeks that I've had to recommend our wiki.

Check it out here, its a really comprehensive list, enjoy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/wiki/comicbooks

---

18: [*Transmetropolitan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan).

You'll thank me after you've read it :-P

4: *Hard Boiled* by Frank Miller

3: If you liked Ghost in the Shell try Appleseed, and if you like your post-apocalyptic cyberpunk with a little more humor (and a lot more gene-altered cat-girls) try Dominion.

2: Ghost in the Shell...and it is not cyberpunk specifically but "Incal" by Moebius is the bible of graphic novels.

2: *Tokyo Ghost*

2: [The Outrunners](http://www.outrunnerscomic.com/Page-0) An ongoing web comic with an accompanying soundtrack.

1: It's short and still ongoing, but [Drugs & Wires](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/dnwcomic/clean-and-sober-living/) is pretty great alt-90s Soviet Bloc cyberpunk. Highly recommend it.

1: It's a little more sci-fi focused, but Trees by Warren Ellis and Jason Howard has a great setting with some awesome cyberpunk vibes in the first issue. I haven't been able to pick up a copy of the second issue, but I certainly intend to.

---

15: Ghost in the Shell.

11: Does *Tokyo Ghost* fit the bill? I pick that if it does.

10: *Judge Dredd*.

> 2: I'd also suggest the Eagle comics run from 83. That was my first intro to him. For what it's worth [here](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5944097/top-11-essential-judge-dredd-stories) is a pretty good article laying out some of his best story lines.

Warren Ellis writes quite of stuff that would be considered cyberpunk and biopunk.

6: *Hard Boiled* by Frank Miller. An oldie but a goodie. Has a ton of gore and sexual content just fyi.

> 3: Underrated. One of Miller's best.

5: I'd suggest Ghost Rider 2099, if you can find it.

5: the original spider-man 2099 and fray are good

2: Frank Millers Ronin fits the bill id say.

1: [Old City Blues](http://ocb.milonogiannis.com/)

## Best authors

### Ed Brubaker

Criminal is one of my favorite sagas in comics and everything he and Sean Phillips have done together I’ve loved, especially *The Fade Out*. Top notch stuff.

Others have mentioned this, but he's really mastered mystery writing. If you've ever picked up his singles and read the backmatter, you can see why. He's always checking out the classics whether it's novels, film, or comics.

I love crime stories and his takes have never disappointed, but he also has some fun superhero tales mixed in. Criminal, Fatale, Incognito, X-Men.

Ed Brubaker - Fatale, Incognito, Kill or Be Killed, *Fade Out* etc.

Everything he's done with Sean Phillips is amazing.

### Warren Ellis

Does high concept stuff really well similar to Morrison, but tackles more modern subject matter. Most notably technology. He also writes “realistic” superheroes the best.

Able to write in so many different styles. Usually is able to insert his sense of occasionally juvenile humor. A bit of a futurist with nostalgia for certain things past, it's always interesting to see where he thinks we might be headed.

His work makes me scared to be in his head. I love that he is never afraid to try anything good or bad. Transmetropliton, Global Frequency, Plantary, Authority, Black Summer, The Wild Storm.

One of comics' best thinkers. Not always the best execution but certainly aiming higher than most out there.

His imaginative and creativity is awesome.

My go-to for a fix of out-there science fiction concepts and ascerbic social and political commentary.

### Jonathan Hickman

A world-builder extroardinaire with a flair for long-game storytelling and a wicked sense of humour. 

He can make complex stories a breeze. 

A long form story telling god, East of West and his Secret Wars saga speak for themselves in this regard. favorite work- East of West

His Avengers/New Avengers saga, concluded in Secret Wars is one of my favorite epics of the medium. Beyond that his indie work is similarly incredible.

### Jeff Lemire

I feel like Lemire is someone who can just do it all. Doesn't matter what genre it is, or if it's even a genre work at all. He can tell a story about two people sitting in a room and it's as interesting as anything. He's great at making his characters feel very human and real, no matter what the situation around them is.

This guy has an amazing ability to tug on your heartstrings. Damn good artist, too.

He is an amazing writer. he knows how to tug at heartstrings and really make you feel for characters. the king of melancholy writing. favorite work- Black Hammer.

His ability to bring something new to established heroes as well as create compelling original stories and characters is very impressive. Moon Knight, Animal Man and Justice League Dark are all fresh and interesting takes and Black Hammer and Sweet Tooth are both incredible stand alone series.

### Frank Miller

He reinvented Batman with **The Dark Knight Returns** and **Year One**, but his work on Daredevil saved the character and turned him into a heartbeat of the Marvel Universe. I love his dialogue and ability to put a Eastwood quote into any situation. He coveys underlying sadness and guilt effortlessly. Both *Daredevil* runs, Just Dark Knight Returns And Year One, 300, Sun City, Ronin.

He's a legend. Like Alan Moore, he is undoubtedly one of the GOATs. Looking past his incredible (and much celebrated) Batman work and Sin City, his four issue Wolverine story is a personal favorite.

### Alan Moore

What's there to really say? Probably the greatest comic writer of all time. Has a thorough understanding of the history of not only the characters he's writing, but literature in general. And is able to weave an incredible amount of ideas in to the smallest amount of details in a panel.

First comic I read was Watchmen, I was pretty young maybe 13. Didn't fully get it at the time, but loved the scope, characters and style of storytelling. It was one of the first times in my life I read a book because I enjoyed it. I've read much of his work and have seriously enjoyed virtually every one.

Because he takes comics to another level of depth, creativity and realism. He exemplifies taking the medium to another level. **Watchmen**, Miracleman, V for Vendetta, Supreme, **Swamp Thing** and **From Hell** are some of the best ever done.

Has a knack for real thematic depth and insight into human nature with a ton of great quotes while still writing stories that are entertaining even just from a relatively shallow perspective.

> Best story arcs-Watchmen, Killing Joke, The Floronic Man arc of Swamp Thing

The best there is. Comics would be completely different without him. No one has had a bigger impact since the 80s.

What can I say that hasn’t already been said? great writer

### Grant Morrison

Like Moore, has a great understanding of the characters he's writing, and knowledge beyond just the comic format. While Moore is generally more subtle in his approach to getting ideas across, Morrison takes the wildest route imaginable. It's usually bombastic and weird, yet always in homage to those that came before him.

I think he’s the greatest writer in the medium’s history. He can do really high concept stuff like The Invisibles or Final Crisis better than anyone.

He makes me think harder than any other writer.

The writer who got me into comics, his Batman is my favorite run and his Vertigo work are some of the best written comics.

Great at high-concept, out-of-this world storytelling. Love his take on superheroes and superhumanity as allegories for humanity striving to be the best possible version of itself, and I dig the generally optimistic worldview many of his stories promote (Even his darker stories have a hopeful undertone to them).

Don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said better by other people but his way of making super stories feel fresh while also very true to their roots is basically unmatched

> He's very similar in writing style to Kojima, with heavy emphasis on metaphysics and meta textual references as well as allusions intended to make you question what is real and pushing the boundaries of what the medium can accomplish.

### Rick Remender

His work tends to feel extremely personal in a way that I don't really see from anyone else. Which isn't to say no one else's work *is* personal to them, but Remender just writes in a way that really shows it. You can easily see what the real-world themes behind the stories are, and it's always very human. It leaves me thinking not only about the specific stories he tells and the characters within them, but how the greater ideas apply to me and my own life. Obviously that's all subjective, and the themes he tends to explore are often relevant to me in the first place.

Rick Remender- amazing story teller, often has unlikeable characters at first you learn to feel for. defiantly the most depressed writer on my list. favorite work- Deadly Class.

> Haven’t heard much about Remender. What works do you recommend? - Mostly his Image books, they're some of my favorite comics, period. The best ones, in my opinion, are LOW, Tokyo Ghost, Black Science, Fear Agent, Deadly Class, Seven to Eternity, and Death or Glory.

Creates these nothing characters and then twists and drags them through Hell without a possibility of relief. Deadly Class, Black Science, Fear Agent, X-Force and Low are inventive and fresh.

### Greg Rucka

Rucka is the one on this list who I've been a fan of the longest. His first Wonder Woman run way back is one of my favorite DC stories of all time, and his current books at Image are some of my favorites. He definitely has a type of character that his books tend to focus on, but I'm a fan of his style.

Love his Wonder Woman, Batman, Gotham Central, and others; I've liked the vast majority of his work that I've read.

Creates worlds that feel relatable. His characters have a weight to them-you can feel them. He would be here just for Lazarus, but Gotham Central, The Old Guard, Wonder Woman, Black Magic are all great stories...just noticed the strong female lead connection.

Very similar reason to Brubaker with crime and spy stories, but Lazarus its self is a thing of beauty. Stumptown, Queen & Country, Veil, The Question, Wonder Woman.

### Scott Snyder

While I like a good portion of his DC work, his Vertigo and Image stuff is where he really shines in my opinion. The Wake, while not often talked about, is a favorite of mine. I'd love to see more Wytches and American Vampire. Hopefully Undiscovered Country doesn't end up in a similar situation.

Batman is my favorite superhero. His Batman work is some of my favorite, from Black Mirror through New 52 Batman and his newer stuff like All-Star Batman, its one of the great runs on a character.

Have only really read his Batman, but Snyder is a jack of all trades. He expertly balances plot, character development, emotion, blockbuster action, big speeches and horror. He always aims high and never phones in a story arc.

> Best Story Arcs-Court Of Owls, Zero Year.

### Brian K. Vaughan

Between **Saga**, Y: The Last Man, and Paper girls, BKV is just *fun*. He has a great sense for balancing light, fun character stuff that makes you like his characters with the more serious, emotional stuff to get the best payoff possible when things start to go bad.

**Saga** is the best comic series ever, imo. Serious credit also goes to Fiona Staples, but combined with Y and The Oath (Dr. Strange), he's one of my go tos.

### Mark Waid

Somewhat similar to Tomasi in terms of writing very human empathetic character driven stories. However, they have different strong suits. Mark Waid is better at having a character arc over the course of a larger story arc, but his individual emotional scene's don't work quite as well as Tomasi's. Also, his runs tend to have a lot of filler arcs without much character development (especially Flash and Daredevil). I like how he's optimistic, but isn't afraid to show his characters as flawed without making them anti heroes. 

> Best story arcs-Superman Birthright, The Return Of Barry Allen, most of his Fantastic Four run.

I think he's the best pure super hero writer it there. No matter the character he does great entertaining work. Daredevil, FF, Spidey are all amazing and he seems to be able to bring the most out of every hero.

### Honorable mentions

Jason Aaron: Great with heroes like Waid, especially Thor obviously, but also able to do good indie stuff. I feel like he's always solid no matter the book.

Jeffrey Brown - his early autobio stuff is still my favourite thing in comics.

Kurt Busiek, Mark Waid, Alan Davis, Roger Stern, Roy Thomas. Because they have written some of the best runs of all time, because they love superheroes, because they don't wish to deconstruct or decompress or derange or de anything, and because their work is smart, and most importantly, fun.

> Kurt Busiek: Astro City and Conan. Both great reads.

Mike Carey - There aren't many other writers out there who can better handle an epic fantasy comic. Mike Carey - Hellblazer, Lucifer, X-men.

Chris Claremont - His X-men magnum opus. His X-Men runs, even when weird are interesting. He developed the superhero team I never can seem to completely stop reading and his issues are favorites.

Peter David-makes me think about the psychology of the character more than anyone else. He is inventive and knows how to inject the kind of humor that make the Marvel movies work, but it is his deep characterization that makes him one of my favorites. Incredible Hulk and X-Factor.

Al Feldstein - brilliant writer, he wrote some of EC’s best stories and paved the way for geniuses like Moore.

Neil Gaiman - he writes stories and creates characters that drive my own imagination (**Sandman**). The most versatile writer I know.

Kieron Gillen - A never-ending fountain of creativity with an incredible grasp of how comicbooks function as a medium, ceaselessly coming up with new ways to use that grasp to push comic book storytelling into new avenues.

Geoff Johns - he knows how to bring wow moments in any comic he writes. Flash, **Green Lantern**.

Mike Mignola: One of the best short story crafters out there. Great sense of mood, pacing and humor. Very poetic.

Peter Milligan - as clever as Moore & Morrison, just check out *Enigma* to see why. His Hellblazer and X-Statix, X-Statix in particular is a great read. Also the Batman story Dark Night, Dark City.

Russel- I love his views on society. I dont always agree with them, but I enjoy them nonetheless. I mean the man got me to pull the Wonder Twins. The Flintstones, Lone Ranger, Prez, God is disappointed in you.

Jeff Smith - his characters, no matter how far fetched they are, seem real and relatable.

## Conclusion

Best comic books: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Sandman**, **Maus**, **From Hell**, **Persepolis**, **Planetary**, **Bone**, **Saga**, **Green Lantern** by Geoff Johns (+**Green Lantern: Secret Origin**), **Saga of the Swamp Thing** (+ [Hellblazer (Constantine)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401230067) | Delano, Ennis, et al. is also good), *Starman*, *Fables*, *Preacher*, *Transmetropolitan*, *Daredevil Born Again*, *Judge Dredd: America*, *Enigma*.

Best Batman comic books: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Court of Owls**, *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*.

Best Joker comic books: **The Man Who Laughs**, **The Killing Joke**, **Death *of* the Family**, **Joker**, **Endgame**.

Best Harley Quinn books: **Batman: Mad Love**.

Best Green Lantern books: **Green Lantern: Secret Origin**, **Green Lantern: Rebirth** and other books in Geoff Johns's Green Lantern Saga.

Best Hellboy books: nearly all of it is written by Mike Mignola and nearly all of it is worth reading. Just start at the beginning with [Hellboy, Volume 1: *Seed of Destruction*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593070942) and follow the rest in [suggested reading order](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2019/) (*Conqueror Worm* is the best story arc among them). Although, the best option would be to buy omnibuses. *Plague of Frogs* BPRD run is also recommended by people. Besides this spin-off, people also recommend these books: *Frankenstein Underground*, *Lobster Johnson*.

Best Swamp Thing books: **Saga of the Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore, *New 52 Swamp Thing* by *Scott Snyder*.

Best The Flash books: 

- Wally West: *The Flash by Mark Waid* - best run!

- Barry Allen: *The Flash (2010-2011) Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues (The Flash: Rebirth series)*, *The Flash (2010-2011): The Road To Flashpoint (The Flash: Rebirth series Book 2)*, *Flashpoint*, New52 Flash, (DC Rebirth #1), Flash: Rebirth (2016) (*The Flash (2016-) Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*), and so forth. 

  > Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*
  >
  > New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Best Wonder Woman books: *Wonder Woman by George Perez Omnibus Vol. 1*, *Wonder Woman By George Perez Omnibus Vol. 2*, *Wonder Woman by George Perez Omnibus Vol. 3*, *Wonder Woman By Greg Rucka Vol. 1* (Rucka's first run), *Wonder Woman by Greg Rucka, Vol. 2* (Rucka's first run), *Wonder Woman Vol. 1: The Lies (Rebirth)* (Rucka is back, it's his second run, and it's good starting point).

Best Blade Runner books: Blade Runner 2019 (it is a pretty fresh run).

Best Doctor Who books:

- **TITAN COMICS**: *Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Vol. 2: The Weeping Angels of Mons* (or Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Complete Year 1 Vol. 1), *Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor Vol. 1-6* (the first two years of [Eleventh Doctor](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Who%3A_The_Eleventh_Doctor)), *3 Volume 1: The Heralds of Destruction*, *9 Volume 1: Weapons of Past Destruction* (+-), *4 Volume 1: Gaze of the Medusa* (+- mediocre plot), *8 Volume 1: A Matter of Life and Death* (+- wishy-washy).

  > Personally, the Titan stuff is fairly easy to find and digest, and is split up pretty well. While artwork in Titan comics can sometimes be wonky as hell (I don't think anyone has been able to do a good Eleventh Doctor from what I've read so far), the stories are mostly good. 

- **DOCTOR WHO MAGAZINE (Marvel/Panini):** *5 Complete: The Tides of Time*, *6 Volume 1: Voyager*, *6 Volume 2: The World Shapers*, entire *8th Doctor's run*, *10 Volume 3: The Crimson Hand*, entire *11th Doctor's run*.

  > The Panini stuff has some great artwork, but it can be a bit dense, and it's more expensive than the Titan stuff, generally. And they have a natural advantage - a much closer connection to the BBC.

- **IDW**: *1-10 Special: The Forgotten*, *1-11 Special: Prisoners of Time*. Just for fun: [Star Trek: The Next Generation / Doctor Who: Assimilation 2: The Complete Series](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Assimilation-Complete/dp/1613777825/) - crossover of Eleventh Doctor and The Next Generation crew of Star Trek.

  >IDW is the worst among those publishers.

Best Judge Dredd books: *Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files #5*, *Origins*, *America*, (+*Complete Case Files #1*, *Complete Case Files #14*).

Best Rick and Morty books: the entire main run.

Best Silent Hill comic books: *Past Life* and *Downpour: Anne's Story* are very good, but the others are really bad.

Best Star Trek comics: *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*, others are not great tbh.

Best Star Wars comics: 

- Legends: *Knights of the Old Republic*.
- Canon: *Darth Vader*, *Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith* (it looks like it's the best SW comics).

Best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: *the current IDW* is the best starting point, *City at War* (Mirage v1 #50-62) is widely viewed as the best TMNT run, *City Fall* (IDW 21-28 - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The IDW Collection Volume 3 (TMNT IDW Collection) I guess) was incredibly good as well.

Best books by genre:

- Fantasy:
- Sci-fi:
  - Cyberpunk: *Transmetropolitan*, *Hard Boiled*, *Judge Dredd*, *Tokyo Ghost*, *Blame!* (+THE LONG TOMORROW and manga: Ghost in the shell, Akira).

Best authors:  **Alan Moore**, **Warren Ellis**, **Grant Morrison**, *Scott Snyder*, *Ed Brubaker*, *Frank Miller*, Greg Rucka, Jeff Lemire, Jonathan Hickman, Rick Remender, Brian K. Vaughan, Mark Waid.
