## Best comics

**Top 5 must read comics**

What are your top 5 comic book series/graphic novels that every comic book fan MUST read? Ones that make you say "if you haven't read this than you aren't a true comic book fan." Comparable to civil war, age of Ultron, etc.

11:

> "if you haven't read this than you aren't a true comic book fan."

I'm not a fan of this sentiment at all, I don't think anyone gets to decide what makes someone a "true" fan of something and I especially wouldn't say someone wasn't a true fan for not having read books like Age of Ultron and Civil War, highly flawed as they are.

That aside, my favorites that I recommend to everybody:

- **Saga of the Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore & Steve Bisette
- **Planetary** by Warren Ellis & John Cassaday
- Chew by John Layman & Rob Guillory
- **Bone** by Jeff Smith
- Stray Bullets by David Lapham

8: There can’t really be a MUST read list, because comics appeal to many different audiences for many different reasons.

The best examples of the medium to me are:

1. **Watchmen** is the best example of the possibilities of the medium.
2. **Maus** is memoir and metaphor done to perfection.
3. **From Hell** is literature.
4. **The Dark Knight Returns** is cinema done as a comic, blending perfect imagery to story. 
5. *Daredevil Born Again* is the greatest exploration of who a character is ever executed.

> 3: I like this answer because it recognizes that "true comic book fan" should probably include the entire medium and not just one (dominant) genre/region.

3: I can say, Civil War and Age of Ultron, would not be on many lists.

But top 5 I would recommend:

1. A Contract With God
2. **Sandman**
3. Astro City
4. Little Nemo
5. **Calvin and Hobbes**

2: **STANDALONE STORIES**

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Kingdom Come**
3. Infinity Gauntlet
4. **The Dark Knight Returns**
5. *Kraven's Last Hunt*

**COMPLETE RUNS**

1. *Daredevil* by Frank Miller
2. *Green Lantern* by Geoff Johns

   > Geoff Johns' entire 9 year run on GL. I don't think anyone can read that entire run without becoming a huge GL fan by the end of it.
3. **Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore
4. Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman
5. Ultimate Spider-Man (Peter Parker) by Brian Michael Bendis

**CURRENT BOOKS**

1. Immortal Hulk by Al Ewing
2. Venom by Donny Cates
3. *The Green Lantern* by Grant Morrison
4. Your Choice of Amazing Spider-Man by Nick Spencer or Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man by Tom Taylor
5. [reserve spot for Jonathan Hickman's House of X and Powers of X and whatever X-Men stuff of his comes next]

2: **Watchmen**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, The Dark Phoenix Saga, **Kingdom Come**, and Kraven’s Last Hunt.

2: *Preacher*, **Batman: Killing Joke**, Spider Man: Maximum Carnage, **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, XMen: Days of Future Past.

2: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, *Judge Dredd: America*, **The Dark Knight Returns**.

> Judge Dredd america is amazing. Judge Dredd year one is some decent fun.
>
> The problem with cherrypicking Dredd is that the later, longer storylines (that is, the multi-part stories, as *Judge Dredd* is published in serial instalments of eight-or so pages in *2000AD* weekly) are grounded in the world gradually introduced in the earlier self-contained strips. One naturally precedes the other. You could just jump into the *Robot Wars* or *The Cursed Earth* and read them, but while they don't rely on the details of Dredd and his world offered previously, they are augmented by it.
>
> Later stories, such as the classic *America* and *Democracy Now!*, work better by being read in their context - that is, Dredd starting as a sci-fi satire on the Dirty Harry-style antihero, then becoming a popular character for its own sake, and then the writers realizing the need to remind the readers that Dredd, and the entire Judge system, is fascist. That gradual drip-feed of information, text and subtext, is what makes Dredd a truly satisfying epic, forty years old and still going strong.
>
> America is a good introduction, other than the Case Files. It is fantastic. Of course, I may be somewhat biased because that is the only Dredd I have read. However as Hugo said (two big paragraphs above), from what I've heard Dredd, it is best to read most stuff in order.

**What are your top 10 must read comics/series?**

24: In no particular order:

- *Scott Pilgrim* (Brian Lee O’Malley)
- *The Vision* (Tom King, Gabriel Walta, & Jordie Bellaire)
- Black Hole (Charles Burns) # really hard
- **Watchmen** (Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons)
- **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman & Everyone)
- **Bone** (Jeff Smith)
- Blankets (Craig Thompson)
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Bagley, Stuart Immonen, David LaFuente, & Sara Pichelli)
- *Astonishing X-Men* (Joss Whedon & John Cassaday)
- **Batman: The Long Halloween** (Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale)
  "+" in other answer: **Kingdom Come** - Even if you don't regularly read their comics, you will know a lot of characters and the art is fantastic.

> 9: Look at this guy, just dropping Black Hole into a list all casual like. The book is good but it is an order of magnitude darker than anything else on that list and two orders more messed up/ unsettling. It feels weird to have that on a list beside Spiderman and *Scott Pilgrim*.

24:

- **All Star Superman** - The best superman book, IMO. Gives the best reasoning for loving the character
- **Kingdom Come** - Even if you don't regularly read their comics, you will know a lot of characters and the art is fantastic.
- Marvels - Same as above, but throw in a lot of great nostalgia
- Fantastic Four (and FF) by Hickman - Great, long story, good art, and shows how the medium can be used for stories.
- Superior Foes of Spider-Man - Funniest book available.
- **Saga** - Shows comics can be more than just tights and spandex.
- Ms. Marvel - I am a sucker for teenage heroes, and this is one of the best modern versions.
- Lumberjanes - It is a joy to read, has a cast and a tone that is unlike most other things.
- *Annihilation* - Cosmic, huge scale warfare. Just epic in the story it tells.
- Gotham Central - Awesome art, and a genre that isn't often explored.

> 6:

> > *Annihilation* - Cosmic, huge scale warfare. Just epic in the story it tells.

> There's a Marvel collections sale happening on Comixology and I'm pretty sure all the major arcs are in it. Finally got to buy them after *acquiring* in my broke high school days. I'm so excited to read it all again.

7: James Robinson - *Starman*

Alan Moore - **Saga of the Swamp Thing** # one guy mentioned this in the top and get many votes

Neil Gaiman - **Sandman**

Mark Waid - **Kingdom Come**

Jeff Smith - **Bone**

Warren Ellis - **Planetary** # there were many mentions on Reddit

Dave Sim - Cerebus (up to about issue 150 - there's good stuff after that but only the first half is *essential*)

Brian Michael Bendis - Ultimate Spider-Man

David Lapham - Stray Bullets

John Layman - Chew

5: 

1. **All-Star Superman** : This is a story that can make even the biggest Superman detractors fall in love with the guy. This is the quintessential Superhero story.
2. **Kingdom Come** : This is an epic. Alex Ross' art gives it the same feel, and it almost feels like mythology. It's amazing.
3. Final crisis : The best of all the crisis, Morrison does something so amazing that I can't even decipher it in a single read. It's the ultimate story, and it reflects why Superman is the greatest superhero.
4. Infinite Crisis : Another Crisis. This shows that we don't need darkness to create good stories. Stories don't need to be dark and edgy for the sake of it. You know what's better than one Superman? Two of them.
5. Geoff Johns' *Green Lantern* : This man brought the GL franchise from zero. He built on the legacy that was left by his previous writers and left it at a level that I don't think any other human can. Such innovation, and so many incredible ideas.

5: I'll just rattle 'em off.

- *Preacher*
- Alan Moore's **Saga of the Swamp Thing**
- Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Amazing Spider-Man
- Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four
- Batman by Grant Morrison
- Uncanny X-Men by Chris Claremont, Dave Cockrum, and John Byrne
- *The Vision* by Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta
- **All-Star Superman**
- *Green Lantern* by Geoff Johns
- Brian Bendis and Alex Maleev's Daredevil

**Comic book fans of Reddit, what comics should everybody read?**

188: **Watchmen**.

143: I really liked the graphic novel **Bone** it had a really interesting story about each character, especially the old humans. It incorporated humor and drama that got me wondering about life in like fifth grade. And of course the Adventures of Tintin.

> 21: **Bone** is fantastic, even for adults. It is very simple, but absolutely fantastic.

133: **Calvin and Hobbes**. I understand it is a comic strip and doesnt directly answer your question, but I love the strip and I am counting it.

> 12: Yeah, it's just a charming and funny comic. Love it. I work in a thrift store and the books of the strips come in some times and I make sure to under-price them insanely so someone can have an awesome find.

115: **Saga**. It's a gloriously over-the-top space opera by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples. Violence, adult themes, heart and humour all wrapped up into one longrunning package.

> 13: Also from Vaughn, *Y the Last Man*, a semi-long running but totally finished work of speculative fiction. Its the story of a man name Yorick and his monkey and they try to make their way through a world following the mysterious death of everyone but them with a Y chromosome.

105:

- [**Sandman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)) - Pretty much the whole series is good,.

- [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(comics)) Start off the the "Hunter Rose Omnibus" for Grendel. Look into the others before buying. Not all of them are as good. 

- Finally, [Cerebus The Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Read it all if you can, from start to finish. It'll take a while, but it's a fucking masterpiece of literature, not just comic books.

  > 13: WARNING ABOUT CERBERUS
  >
  > At one point the creator gets dumped and the book mutates into a weird misogynist screed with page upon page of text and doodles masquerading as a comic.

> 8: I would add: **Planetary**, and The Authority.

73: A lot of classics already mentioned, I'll list some of my favorites I haven't seen mentioned yet.

*Preacher* (all of it)

Batman: Under The Red Hood

Batman: Hush

**Batman: The Long Halloween**

Batman: Court of Owls, City of Owls, Death of the Family, Endgame

Green Lantern: Blackest Night, Brightest Day

The Death of Superman

House of M

Civil War

Planet Hulk, World War Hulk

Infinity Guantlet, Infinity

Thor God of Thunder: The God Butcher, Godbomb

68: **All-Star Superman**.

> 9: Legit one of the best comic books ever made imo and probably the best Superman story.

51: **Maus** by Art Spiegelman. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/08/11/why-maus-remains-the-greatest-graphic-novel-ever-written-30-years-later/?utm_term=.5e7c7f42833a

51: *Scott Pilgrim* (all of them)

44: [Old Man Logan](https://youtu.be/cNAD0fTBn2I)

> 12: You want the one (tom) written by Mark Millar.

48: *Y the Last Man*

44: *Preacher*. The show doesn't even compare to how well made the comic is.

> 4: The characters are great. Its the directing they're trying to pace themselves and build up plot but its so damn boring and feels like filler. Why are they using the love triangle arc?? Cassidy was never "in love" with Tulip like in the show. I can tell they're building to where they fight over her and its gonna suck. I wanted the second Season to be about them going to New York and THEN being kidnapped by the L'angels. Sorry long reply.

44: The 2012 run of *Hawkeye* by Matt Fraction. It’s a slow, almost noir-like story about *Hawkeye’s* everyday life as a single guy in New York who is also a superhero. It’s really brilliant.

24: 
Complete: 

- *Fables* - Fairy tale people live in NY. Eventually there's a big war with their home world.

- **Watchmen** - I thought it was just okay, but the overall consensus is that it's amazing. Realistic super hero story that flips tropes.

- *Y: The Last Man* - All but let's say one man dies. The world handles that pretty poorly.

- and maybe The Boys - Super heroes are real, but they're more like celebrities. Also they're terrible people deserving of death.


Still running:

- **Saga** - Do you like a colorful world filled with action and sex? Then you'll love saga.

- The Walking Dead - The pretty good zombie comic that inspired the shitty show. Lulls after the prison, lulls again after All Out War.

  > 9: The first arc of *Fables* dealing with the adversary was great, but it lost steam after that. The first four chapters are still one of my favourite comic arcs.
  
  > 7: For me The Boys swings between trying to catch my breath from laughter, and putting it down and looking for videos of kittens to try and block out the awful.

25: **Saga**

Invincible

**Sandman**

DMZ

*Daredevil: Born Again*

Punisher MAX (Garth Ennis run)

Hellboy

The Walking Dead

**Essential Graphic Novels Everyone Should Read**

1. **Maus Complete**. (Includes Maus + Maus II)
2. The Contract With God Trilogy
3. *Sin City*: The Hard Goodbye
4. **The Watchmen**
5. **Persepolis**
6. The Black Hole
7. Kabuki: Circle Of Blood
8. Ghost In The Shell
9. The Killer
10. *Blacksad*


41: **The Sandman**

26: "Fun Home" by Alison Bechdel and "Daytripper" by Fabio Moon and Gabriel Ba are the two I always recommend to people

> 10: I'm surprised *Fun Home* didn't make the initial list. It's an iconic graphic novel by an iconic artist, and a cultural touchstone especially for the lesbian community/ lgbt community at large.

20: I think not enough credit is given to old-fashioned superhero comics. "**The Dark Knight Returns**" is as good as "*Sin City*" and "**The Killing Joke**" as good "**Watchmen**", but they are somehow more likely to be overlooked because they are Batman, so can't be taken seriously? I mean, a vigilante in a cape is somehow less mature than a giant dong?

Then, to go further, why treat either of them more than your standard "comic strips" that can tell a story in only a few frames.

I guess this, for me, is my rant about how "visual book" lovers can be just as pretentious as those who just read words-only. A person can love Jack Reacher and find no interest in Humbert Humbert, without being a lesser reader. Likewise, Garfield has just as much validity in story-telling as "*V for Vendetta*".

---

**What are the the "must read" graphic novels?**

I read a lot of comics when I was a little kid and teenager, but as an adult I couldn't really get into them anymore. I read a lot but just non-fiction and comics mostly felt too childish or shallow for me to find them interesting. A few, though, were really great: I read Hayo Miyazaki's Nausicäa and found there all the things I like about the man's movies plus I really enjoyed the art. Other enjoyable series was Vinland Saga by Makoto Yukimura, it was a really solid work and the art got really impressive. Western comics I really have not dabbled with.

What would be the best of the best for graphic novels then? Watchmen maybe, what else? I'm not dissing the art form, just really unfamiliar with the scene and it's not necessarily my thing, but can appreciate good stories and art.

38: "**From hell**" by Alan Moore. Revolves around the mystery of Jack the ripper. With insight to lot of conspiracy theories and postulations. Everything in the book is meticulously detailed and researched, down right the weather of the particular scene. It's extensive and an achievement in the medium. For me from hell represents the maximum potential of the graphic novel as a medium.

27:

- Jimmy Corrigan by Chris Ware
- Love and Rockets by Los Bros Hernandez
- **Maus** by Art Spiegelman
- The Complete Crumb by R. Crumb
- American Splendor by Harvey Pekar
- **Watchmen**, *V for Vendetta* and **From Hell** by Alan Moore (and Dave Gibbons, David Lloyd and Eddie Campbell)
- Eightball by Daniel Clowes
- Krazy Kat by George Herriman
- A Contract with God by Will Eisner
- **Sandman** by Neil Gaiman and various artists

That was the best I could think of off the top of my head. I'll probably kick myself later for not thinking of others.

Edit: Dammit. I knew I would:

- Prophet by Brandon Graham and Simon Roy
- Black Hole by Charles Burns
- Lone Wolf & Cub by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima
- **Calvin and Hobbes** by Bill Watterson
- Corpse on the Imjin and Other Stories by Harvey Kurtzman
- Palestine by Joe Sacco
- Tales from the Crypt by Various

> 6: Yeah this is probably the most complete one on the thread. I would add Frank by Jim Woodring, *Preacher* by Garth Ennis, Peanuts by Charles Schulz, and Fun Home by Alison Bechdel.

21: 

- **Watchmen**
- **Maus**
- **Persopolis**

I’d have to add **Dark Knight Returns** but it has no where near the critical acclaim or mainstream, general recognition of the other three.

> **Dark Knight Returns** is Frank Miller’s version of an old, embittered Batman. I don’t think Nolan took anything interesting from this version, personally. I love this comic though, I have a hard time deciding if DKR or Watchmen is ‘better’.
>
> This is the book that transformed Batman from the old comedy tv show to the much darker batman we're used to nowadays. It's pretty political though, at least one friend I lent it to didn't like it because he didn't agree with the political statements.

18: Daytripper. **Saga**. Deadly class.

Those 3 are my favs.

> 6: Daytripper is the GOAT.

17: I'll throw this out: *Blacksad*. Artwork is really good (animals / humans); stories are well written (detective noir). It is not western, so you may find it familiar.

15: Since you mentioned Nausicäa, and I loved that also, here are some of my favorites:

- [The Incal](https://www.humanoids.com/y_catalog/book/id/564)  by Alexandro Jodorowsky (Artist/Director collaborated on a failed 'Dune' adaptation. [For anyone who hasn't see 'Jodorowsy's Dune', please do yourself a favor] Most of that work ended up in this trippy sci-fi epic) and Moebius (the incredible Jean Girard does these fantastically detailed and mind-melting drawings.)
- [**Bone**](http://www.boneville.com/comic/bone-issue-one-cover-2/) by Jeff Smith (at first glance looks childish, but is actually a well-thought out, solid fantasy story) 
- [**Saga**](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/saga) by Brian K. Vaughan (mentioned elsewhere, but it's awesome)
- And anything ever drawn by Seth Fisher like [Willworld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1415722.Green_Lantern) or [Fantastic Four/Ironman: Big in Japan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1085273.Fantastic_Four_Iron_Man) (he was a playfully eccentric genius comic artist, died tragically young)

> 6: I'm reading **Bone** for my son at the moment. It's not many stories that both a 42 year old and a 8 year old can appreciate.

13: A turn of the century classic that's been on my mind recently is *Transmetropolitan* by Warren Ellis. Great story, strong characters, and extremely relevant to our current political and social climates. The main character is a Hunter S. Thompson type journalist who peruses a cyberpunk world advocating for Transients (human-alien trans people) and fighting against insanely corrupt government officials. Check it out.

12: **The Sandman** by Neil Gaiman

8: My top 5 recommended novels or series are the following:

**Saga** by Brian K. Vaughn, Essex County by Jeff Lemire, **Bone** by Jeff Smith, **Maus** by Art Spieglman, Berlin by Jason Lutes

**What Are Your Favorite Comics to Recommend to People?**

I've read a lot of comic books, but I still feel like there are so many amazing stories I haven't even touched, what are some of your favorite comic books that you think everyone should read?

5: Top Ten by Alan Moore. It's a very non-Alan-Moore-like comic. Fun, entertaining and bright. It's yet another take on his usual schtick ("what if superheroes really existed in the real world") but it's done with a sense of fun and the end result is a great comic book.

4: *Transmetropolitan*, Astro City, and Ultimate Spider-Man.

3: It depends on what they are looking for. For those who want something outside the realm of Superheroes usually Essex County. For those who want Superhero stories but done in a different way **All Star Superman**, and for those who just want a great starting point to get into comics usually Ultimate Spider-Man.

4: 

- **All-Star Superman**
- Hellboy
- American Vampire
- *Green Lantern* by Geoff Johns
- JLA by Grant Morrison and Howard Porter
- Daredevil by Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev
- Superman (including Man of Steel mini) by John Byrne
- Hellblazer (all of it but especially the Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon run)
- *Astonishing X-Men* by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday
- Hack/Slash

5:

- **Watchmen**
- *Kraven's Last Hunt*
- S.H.I.E.L.D by Hickman
- *V for Vendetta*
- Old Man Logan
- **The Killing Joke**

### Best single issues

**What's your favorite single issue comic book you have ever read?**

32: **Age of Ultron 10.A**. Hank Pym's story told beautifully in one issue. It's that good.

> 3: Oh, I really liked this one. Only thing from AoU that I really enjoyed, tbh.

> 3: I really had no particular feeling for Henry before I read that. Boy, did that changed. I'm wishing he was the one to be featured in the Ant-Man movie now.

> 2: That's the issue that made Hank Pym one of my favorite characters.

[deleted comment] - probably "**Animal Man #5: The Coyote Gospel**".

> 4: Morrisons Animal Man is one of my favorite stories of all time. The final issue is the one i think is most memorable.

20: Hard to choose, but *Watchmen #4* (Watchmaker) and *#5* (*Fearful Symmetry*) are both incredible issues in terms of storytelling, art, layout, and dialogue/inner monologue.

19: Either '*Slay Ride*', the Batman issue where the Joker has Robin tied up in the car as he drives around and kills people on Christmas Eve, or then issue of Sandman where Lucifer guides Morpheus through Hell as he locks it up.

18: *Sandman issue #6 24 Hours*. Scariest piece of fiction I've ever encountered, and the first thing that got me really on board with what is now my favorite comic book series.

16: **Animal Man #5, "The Coyote Gospel"** is as good as it gets for me. Silly and tragic and thought-provoking. Can't ask for much more from comics.

15: *All-Star Superman, Issue 10*: Neverending. Anyone who has ever read it knows why.

"Your doctor really did get held up, Regan."

16: I'm not going to pick a single issue, but here are a few that stuck with me:

- **Coyote Gospel, Animal Man #5**.
- Pog, Saga Of Swamp Thing #32.
- Ghost Dance, Saga Of Swamp Thing #45.

Some amendments, adding as they come to mind:

- Acceptance, Batman and Robin #23.
- Pizza Dog, Hawkeye #11.

> 3: The Pizza Dog issue was one of the most innovative issues I've ever read.
>
> > 1: Check out the Pog issue, it does a similar thing with language in it. For some reason I want to say it's reminiscent of Chris Ware's work, too, but I'm not sure why really.

> 2: I think Pog is my answer as well. At forst I didn't want to read it because it went away from the story arc but it is the most beautiful little story. It is on the top of my wishlist atm. Gonna get it soon.

11: New Avengers #23.

Occurring right after the Illuminati's confrontation with the Great Society, they all give up on trying to combat the Incursions and spend their last few hours with themselves and their loved ones. I loved this issue because it was a revealing look at each of some of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel universe and how they would spend their last moments alive. From Tony coming to terms with his conquering of alcoholism, to Dr. Strange asking Wong, "Am I a good man?", there was so much to appreciate in it.

10: The first issue of Mark Waid's Daredevil run with art by Paolo Rivera. The first page alone is remarkable.

10: Tie between **Action Comics #775** "**What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?**", and Astro City V1 #1 "In Dreams"

> 4:
>
> > Astro City V1 #1 "In Dreams"
>
> Best Superman story ever written, despite not being about Superman.

> 2: I came here to say **Action Comics #775**. It was such a great story. Plus I love that they put it in a single issue, and not the arc stuff DC does with ever comic now.
>
> > 1: It also had a giant gorilla! Never see those anymore...
> >
> > > 1: Actually in the new Geoff Johns Superman run he brought back titano, a giant robot gorilla. If memory servers it was Superman #32.

8: I might have to say New Mutants #35. It is the issue where Magneto becomes the headmaster in place of Professor X.

9: [*Swamp thing #21*](http://thegreatcomicbookheroes.blogspot.com/2013/08/swamp-thing-21-anatomy-lesson-game.html)

> 2: I was going to say the same thing. It's a great horror story and the way it's nerrated is extra creepy.

8: I wouldn't say it's my favorite, but there's an old issue of Fantastic Four that I had as a kid where in the story a kid who really looked up to the Human Torch lights himself on fire to be like him. He gets terrible burns all over his body and is sent to the hospital, where the man who gave him the experimental gasoline to try it is sent to jail. The parents of the kid get really upset with Human Torch and tell him that he should be ashamed of himself for showboating his powers and being a bad influence for kids. The issue ends with the kid dying in the hospital and the Human Torch giving up his position on the Fantastic Four. Again, not my *favorite* issue, but one that I still think about every now and again. I think it still sticks with me because it was one of the first examples where I'd seen a comic book get really serious with such a sad ending. Before I really started reading, as a younger kid, I thought they were all fun and games, where the hero always triumphs and everybody has a happy ending, but this was one of the issues that I first ever read and I didn't realize how serious comics could be.

> 2: Issue 285. As you said that's a really serious story with a lot of emotion, especially for a young reader.

> 1: Good issue. I agree the emotions make it work. Although if you really think about the premise, you have to assume that this couldn't be the first time something like this happened in the Marvel Universe. With all of these real life heroes in the world, and knowing how impressionable little kids can be, dozens of kids must get killed every year trying to imitate some heroes. Jumping off roofs, trying to fly and so forth.

6: X-Men Vol. 2 #75 - It's the first comic I remember reading; I was in a Walgreens waiting for my mom to finish shopping. I loved the X-Men cartoon growing up and then to discover that there were other stories out there in the same universe was incredible. It also introduced me to my favorite X-Men character, Maggott.

> 5: I'm stunned at this choice.

6: Either Fell #1 or the Killing Joke. Or maybe Arkham: A Serious House on a Serious Earth.

> 3: Picking a favorite issue of Fell is really difficult. The layouts for #9 with the standoff were crazy awesome, and I really liked the method of three panels with post-it notes for #8.
>
> > 2: I really wish this story had continued, but there is also something so "Fell" about the way it just drops off.
>
> > 1: They're all pretty good, but I feel like the first issue did a great job at setting the tone.
> >
> > Also the dialogue had me laughing like no other.

3: [Amazing Spider-Man #400](http://marvel.wikia.com/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_400) - a great Spidey story, but also a wonderfully human and emotional story. You think things like Superior and Spider-Verse are good? They might be, but they don't hold a candle to this.

Sentimental runner up: [Uncanny X-Men #350](http://marvel.wikia.com/Uncanny_X-Men_Vol_1_350) - "The Trial of Gambit" - because it was my holy grail book, the one I couldn't find for the longest time. Also, it shed a lot of light on what was, up until then, the very mysterious character of Gambit. Great read, lovely art, al around goodness.

5: First issue of Saga. It was clear by the end that I would be reading the entire series, however long it guess on for.

4: The first thing that comes to mind is Wonder Woman v3 issue #34. Though this is the first issue in a two issue story arc, this particular issue will always remain one of my favorite comic moments. Diana and Dinah (Black Canary) spend time together and we get to see their friendship. It's a great issue of character development. I miss issues like this, where two (or more) characters can just get together, relax, be themselves, and have fun. This style of story seems so incredibly rare these days, especially in DC Comics.

While I don't think I would call that issue my single favorite issue ever, it is definitely up there.

3: [Daredevil #191](http://images.wwcomics.com/images/large/DD_191_WP.jpg) is not only a fantastic one-and-done comic, but it also serves as a great cap off to Frank Miller's original run on the character.

5: Hellblazer #27- Hold Me

3: New X-men # 139, the issue where Jean finally catches Scott and Emma cheating. We figure out how crazy and psychotic Jean can be with the power of the Phoenix Force. We get a dive into why Emma is the way she is. Scott finally reveals that he's sick of the Phoenix Force always screwing up his life and relationship. Then we finally see some retaliation from Scott and Jean towards Professor X, and it sort of shows the beginning of them breaking away from him as a mentor.

> 2: The best use of two telepaths since Xavier's Shadowking fight in the original Claremont run.
>
> > 2: Well, there was also that issue, where Emma and Jean went into Cassandra Nova's booby trapped mind to search for Professor X's conscience. There was like only one panel with words, but it was definitely a brilliant read.

4: Uncanny X-Men #139. Claremont's run I is my favorite comic run ever. And this issue debuted my favorite X-Men, Kitty Pride.

4: Tough to say exactly, but here are three that come to mind:

Hawkeye #3 (clint goes to buy tape)

East of West #15 (the son of death awakes)

*Watchmen #5* (*fearful symmetry*)

---

**[Recommendation] What are the best single issues?**

Maybe not standalone, but issues that were just beyond amazing. Maybe that one issue in a mediocre arc, or an issue that pushed what the comic medium could do.

For example, Batman #5 of the New 52 by Scott Snyder, is amazing. It has this intense atmosphere, but is also trippy and pushes the medium into something different and unique. Got me thinking what other great issues are out there. If there is a heap of context that needs to be understood for an issue please mention it because i'll try and pick up the arc. If it's standalone that's also cool!

9: If I didn't include the title of an issue, it's because I don't remember it. If you remember it I'm more than happy to edit.

• Planetary 27

• Fantastic Four 588 "Month Of Mourning"

• FF 23

• *All-Star Superman 10*

• All-Star Superman 6 "Funeral in Smallville"

• Spider-Man: Blue 6

• Amazing Spider-Man 122 "The Night Gwen Stacy died part 2"

• Giant Size Astonishing X-Men 1

• Sandman 8 "Sound of her Wings"

• Uncanny X-Force 34

• Ultimate Spider-Man 160

• Ultimate Spider-Man 13 "Confession" (?)

• Daredevil 181

6: [The Lobo Paramilitary Christmas Special.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lobo_Paramilitary_Christmas_Special_Vol_1_1)

5: Any of Barry Windsor Smith's X-men issues...

4: BPRD #124 is probably the best one shot story I've ever read. And you don't really need to know anything about the series to understand it because it follows a civilian rather than the established characters.

The Humans #3 (the Vietnam issue) was also spectacular, and most Grayson issues are more or less stand alone as well (my favorite of those being the Annual).

> 3: The coffee shop story of BPRD is one of the best

> 3: One of my favorite pages from all of BPRD
>
> http://i.imgur.com/IN9EkPs.jpg

3: Saga of The *Swamp Thing #21* is a great single issue horror story.

4: Astro City is mostly comprised of amazing one shots, all set in a silver age DC analogue, stories that really make you consider previously neglected aspects of superheroing. They are all really great, but some particularly poignant ones are.

Astro City #1 (also known as "In Dreams")

Astro City #1/2 (also known as "The Nearness of You)

Some of my other favourites are.

The Goon #7 - Hellboy crossover featuring The Communist Airborne Mollusc Militia.

Daredevil #181 - Bullseye kills Elektra, such incredible artwork, the scene where Bullseye jovially runs Elektra through with her own sai is, well [just see for yourself](https://36.media.tumblr.com/8892ab3fce6cce893dc8a6b19a4397c7/tumblr_miwgd1zPPl1rxrnbio6_500.jpg).

3: I think the short story in "A Guide To The Known Keys" from Locke and Key is the single best issue of any comic that I have read. The art is gorgeous, the writing is great, and I've never been so emotionally impacted by a book, comic or otherwise.

> 5: That book is downright magical. You're right, so much emotion.

3: Hitman #34

3: The Flash #8 - Purple Haze (i love the twists and turns in this issue)

The Punisher #18 - Downtown (Punisher comic by Ennis on the troubles)

3: Astro City vol. 2 #1/2: The Nearness of You - Everyone should read this issue. It's amazing.

3: "Who is Donna Troy" by Wolfman and Perez from *New Teen Titans*

"Little Red Book" by Puckett and Parobeck from *Batman Adventures*

"For the Man Who Has Everything" by Moore and Gibbons, *Superman Annual*

"The Player on the Other Side" by Barr and Golden, *Batman Special*

"Slumber Party" by Claremont and Sienkiewicz *New Mutants*

*Superman* #400 by Maggin and various artists.

3: I love a lot of the Sandman issues. Anything with Death or from Vol.3 "Dream Country"

3: Moon Knight's "Sleep"

3: Gonna throw in *Moon Knight #5*.

---

**Best single issue you've ever read**

16: Probably **Pax Americana** or detective comics 880

12: I love *the single issue of Bendis' daredevil with no dialog*. I think it was a single issue but Maleev's art is spectacular and tells a great story.

> 6: The one where he stops the assassin who is trying to kill him? I loved that one! Speechless comics are really cool and really let art do the talking. East of West has one (#23?) and I just could not help "re-reading" it.
>
> > 9: One of Matt Fraction's Hawkeye issues isn't speechless, but it is wordless. It's seen through the eyes of a dog.
> >
> > http://marvel.com/comics/issue/42772/hawkeye_2012_11
> >
> > And Crowdower isnt lying, its fucking great
>
> > 2: 22

11: **Animal Man #5: The Coyote Gospel**.

New X-Men #121: Silence! Psychic Rescue in Progress.
JLA #14: Twlight of the Gods (Rock of Ages Part 5).

> 7: 
>
> > JLA #14: Twlight of the Gods (Rock of Ages Part 5).
>
> Was that the issue where J'onn reshapes his brain to be more like the Joker's so he and Superman can escape that deathmaze, or is that the issue where the future versions of the Atom and Connor Hawke kill Darkseid with a light-arrow?
>
> Man, just writing those two line gave me shivers and instantly made me want to re-read that entire run.
>
> > 6: The latter one, which is narrated by fucking *Death himself*, the Black Racer and the JLA blows up Darkseid's *Zombie Factory* on the goddamn moon.
> > Rock of Ages is rad as hell.
> >
> > > 2: It's pretty much the reason I read comics. That and Manhattan Projects.
>
> > 3: 
> >
> > > Animal Man #5: The Coyote Gospel.
> >
> > I came here to say the same. Just an incredible single issue.

9: *All Star Superman #10*

8: *Warren Ellis' Moon Knight #5* is the first that comes to mind

10: Probably *Alan Moore's Swamp Thing #21: The Anatomy Lesson*. The retcon to end all retcons.

EDIT: #21, not #1.

> 5: I can't remember which number it is, but the psychedelic fruift eating sex issue is the one I'd pick.
>
> > 6: Issue #34: Rite of Spring
> >
> > Yeah, that's a very close runner up, I tend to switch back and forth on which one I prefer - The Anatomy Lesson is a masterpiece of horror, the growing tension and sense of atmosphere are just phenomenal, but Rite of Spring has [my single favourite romantic quote in any comic](http://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgd8w1eQxJ1qz4ymjo1_500.jpg), and some of the [best damn art I've ever seen](http://66.media.tumblr.com/ecdb5c5a4ca1243dfe75c5aee0b363c2/tumblr_n1k4o9MHo61tu5eyto1_500.jpg).

7:

- Moon Knight #4 by Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey
- *Moon Knight #5 by Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey*
- Venom #21 by Rick Remender and Declan Shalvey
- Low #7 by Rick Remender and Greg Tocchini
- Secret Wars #2 by Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribic

**7: What's so funny about truth, justice and the American Way**.

7: Hard to pick just one, but I might have to go with the first issue of Superman: Red Son. Also a big fan of Green Arrow #24 by Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino.

7: During the Spider-Verse event there was a one off alt world story about a Peter Parker type character. It had all the basic origin story trappings Abut it had this creepy horror twist to it. Peter was a sociopath who liked to burn ants for fun, was abused by his uncle, had a weird obsession with the red headed neighbor girl, and got these odd spider powers. It was more like a mutation, and it caused him to have cravings and act more spider-like than man. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it's intense, and so so creepy. A great horror twist on a classic heroic character.

> 3: Edge of Spider-Verse #4:
>
> http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50962/edge_of_spider-verse_2014_4

5: [Uncanny X-Men 245](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pq1UcuoCx9Y/VBndN0fEBqI/AAAAAAAAWfw/6ktJ8XQOS3c/s1600/cover.jpg).

It's during the Outback X-Men era. Basically, the men have a boys day in town, and wind up encountering an alien invasion. I love it because it's a great, lighthearted break from what is otherwise a pretty heavy time for the X-Men, and it has so many hilarious moments.

Honorable mention: The last issue of Avengers Academy. I loved how the series it began and ended with Veil in high school (and god I loved Mettle).

Other honorable mention: The last issue of pre-crisis Flash. It was a satisfying end for Barry, and the panel with the Rogues toasting him at the end makes me feel warm and fuzzy.

> 4: Loved this as a kid. It's a parody of DC's Invasion event isn't it? Absolute classic and hilarious to boot.

> 2: Avengers Academy was amazing, I wish the students would appear in other titles

5: I've been only really getting back into comics this year, but [Kill or Be Killed #1](https://thecolespot.com/2016/08/07/kill-or-be-killed-1/) has to be one of the best opening comics I've read in a while.

> 2: Stray Bullets, 100 Bullets and Kabuki cover a lot of similar existential despair of a life of crime. There's a reason most people avoid organized criminals and hired guns. Pretty sure you should always be careful about coercing strangers to doing anything out of line with their identity. That would be a very risky Shakespearian act... Caesar's last words and all that

---

**What are some of best single issues of DC?**

Curious what you folks consider the great individual chapters in DC's rich history.

I'm thinking along the lines of "**The Coyote Gospel**" and *All Star Superman #10*. Issues which work as standalone stories with or without being integral parts of the larger stories.

15: "*For The Man Who Has Everything*" and "**What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way?**"

> 2: Great picks! One spawned a great movie and the other my favorite episode of JLU

14: *Batman and Robin 18*.

I never cared for Damian, but oh my... My oh my did that issue leave a mark.

11: **Pax Americana**

> 5: And Ultra Comics

8: *Sandman #18, A Dream of a Thousand Cats*

8: Doom Patrol #45

> 4: "Punks were lucky. No beards."
>
> EDIT: OH GOD AND MORRISON HIMSELF WAS NOBEARD THE PIRATE IT'S ALL CONNECTED THE HYPERCRISIS IS REAL!

8: The Flash vol 2 #0

8: Grayson #12 , Batman #51

> 4: I second on Batman #51 (from Snyder and Cappullo's run.) Great issue!

6: Grayson Future's End One Shot, just has some totally unexpected awesome moments.

5: Hellblazer #27 "Hold Me" by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean.

3: *Paul Dini Slayride*

3: Batman #44 by Scott Snyder, Brian Azzarello, and Jock

3: Any particular character?

Detective Comics #439, 442, 476, 500

Superman #247

Wonder Woman (Post-Crisis) #45

Christmas with the Superheroes #2

Birds of Prey #55

Every issue of The Question

3: I personally love Grayson #12

## Opinions about New 52 and Rebirth

> One of the unique features of the DC Universe is the Crisis events. These are events with major consequences for the entire DC multiverse and usually there is a new status quo after each event.
>
> The New 52 was a line-wide relaunch of every DC Comic in 2011. This relaunch was specifically designed to provide new readers with a place to start reading. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[New 52 Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/new-52-reading-order/)** and begin reading.
>
> The latest jumping on point is DC Rebirth (2016). All series were relaunched with the intent to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the “**Flashpoint**” event, while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52. If this is where you want to begin then head over to the [DC Rebirth Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-rebirth-reading-order/) and start reading.

31: It sacrificed decades of character growth for a sales gimmick.

28: 

1. No one knew what was canon and what wasn’t because Batman and GL were in the middle of definitive runs and were selling well, so they didn’t get rebooted at all, but the reboot meant none of their past stories made sense now
2. All of Lee’s buddies seemed to get jobs they didn’t deserve like Liefeld
3. Good creative talent kept leaving because of clashes with editorial like Lemire, Diggle, Cornell, etc
4. A lot of legacy heroes got screwed like Wally West, Tim Drake, Conner Kent, usually acting so different they might as well have been different characters
5. The main characters were changed pretty radically in some ways. Sometimes it worked out like with (imo) Azz WW and Morrison Superman, but even when it did work out, the following creative teams usually did a terrible job

There were still good, definitive runs though like Johns Aquaman or JL, or Snyder Batman. But they just got submerged beneath the tidal wave of crap, especially with DC launching a ton of #1’s all at once.

9: To me, New 52 is a distillation of everything I dislike about DC:

1. Overly edgey stories and ideas (Superman being a jerk and having his parents die in a car accident)
2. A Whatever approach to continuity ( Everything is reset except Batman and Green Lantern even though important DC events happen in Green Lantern and are hinged on Post-Crisis continuity, like Blackest Night)
3. Throwing out or killing legacy characters (Wally is gone, Tim Drake was never Robin or apart of the Bat-family)
4. It plays on an idea Marvel has beaten to death lately; high sales for new number 1s. It works temporarily but sales even out after a while

The real kicker is I started reading comics with New 52 Batman. I appreciate New 52 for being my entryway into comics but can see its glaring flaws.

7: It threw out a bunch of characters that a lot of fans love, or twisted their personalities and origins until they barely resembled themselves.

There were some good things that came out of the New 52 but ultimately it has done far more harm than good. It doesn't help that the damage seems to be permanent at this point :(.

6: It wasn’t a complete reboot. The theory was that everyone got much younger, yet Batman still had all of his family (bar Cass Cain and Steph Brown) and GL still had most of his history intact.

Superman got a complete shaft by being written as more of an arrogant man with no semblance of pre-Flashpoint personality and his parents died because of something Superman could prevent, instead of the heart attack that took Jonathan Kent instead.

Many of the romances and relationships that defined the DC Universe were also phased out of existence, the most notable being Lois and Clark (in favour of WW and Clark), Green Arrow and Black Canary (revisited in Rebirth), Barry and Iris (wasn’t even considered until Rebirth either, and much further down the line) and Wally and Linda Park (which STILL doesn’t even exist).

The history of the Titans and the Young Justice-era Teen Titans were also changed. Conner Kent, Tim Drake and Bart Allen were completely altered, with Conner and Bart missing until recently (Bart returned after Flash War and Conner is coming back soon) and Tim Drake immediately donning the Red Robin mantle instead of having a stint as a Robin himself. Starfire was part of the Outlaws and Beast Boy and Raven weren’t even around. Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal and Garth also seemingly had their own version of the team removed. The Justice Society and the Legion of Superheroes were also a no-show from my knowledge and many characters (Plastic Man, Hawkgirl, Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Wildcat, Dr Fate, Elongated Man, etc.) were missing until Rebirth, and some still are. Martian Manhunter, a member of the original seven, was considered an antihero for a while until he returned in Metal.

While the majority of the New 52 was hard to read (I started with Batman: Hush and the Meltzer JL run, but I started fully investing in the universe when the New 52 came out), some of it turned out great. Snyder’s Batman run, Morrison’s Action Comics, Azzarello’s Wonder Woman, Lemire’s Green Arrow, Geoff Johns’ revitalisations of the Justice League (leading to a culmination in Darkseid War) and Aquaman (setting new precedents and status quo for the character) and the Justice League Dark’s popularity. However, were these things worth the complete culling of DC’s known history up to that point? Absolutely not.

4: Legacy characters got fucked and there was some **BAD** writing

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight.

Even rebirth now is hitting some heavy lows.

2: I think the main reason is because it was so poorly planned. You could tell they had no real idea what they were doing and it just made a mess of things. Big things were set up and then just tossed to the side with no real payoff because they were constantly changing their minds on what they were doing. It just made things so sloppy. You would constantly see things brought up in one book that would contidicted in another because no one knew what was and wasn't part of the Nu52 cannon. This was especially bad on the books with teen characters like Titans since no one knew what the hell was going on with their new histories.

2: It was the time all the executives and editors in DC agreed that maybe the 90s weren't that bad after all.

---

18: Easily rebirth. There was so much trash in the 52. Rebirth is setting things right

8: Rebirth, by a long shot. N52 threw almost everything I cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

4: We had *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*, Animal Man by Jeff Lemire, Wonder Woman by Brian Azarello, Action Comics by Grant Morrison, Justice League by Geoff Johns, Aquaman by Geoff Johns, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, Batwoman by J H Williams.

Personally, that is why I would pick New 52 compared to Rebirth, it just feels like there were stronger titles and iconic storylines unlike Rebirth which feels more like a routine. Yeah, some will see the characters are better but where is the epic ? Where is the stuff that will make someone look back on it in 5 years and say " Damn, Rebirth was THE thing to read "

> 3: Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**.
>
> Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batwoman, Justice League, Bargirl - just to mention a few - had much stronger titles in the New 52. I became a big fan of both Batwoman and Aquaman because of their New 52 runs. If I had read their Rebirth run at the time instead I wouldn’t have been anywhere near as interested in them as I am now.

4: Gotta go with N52. Batman is my 2nd favorite hero of all time and *Snyder's run* was just plain f'cking epic. Tom King's has been meh to eh at best. Otherwise Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and I actually like that.

> 1: The New 52 Batman and New 52 Gl only benefitted from the new 52s darker tones.

4: Didn't New 52 Superman say guns are for sissies to an officer? How is that not being a confident, condescending dick? He didn't say he doesn't need them, he indirectly called all soldiers and cops sissies. Real down-to-earth class act. Just saying.

2: New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2.

2: New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the dc business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga.

---

12: DC New 52 was the Reboot of Comics continuity that started in 2011. It de-aged, rewrote, and threw out a lot classic stories to attract new readers and start from scratch. It officially lasted until 2015, where the books went through a brief "creator orientated" period, that saw many characters go through more apparent changes and stories (Green Lantern a criminal, Superman powerless, Jim Gordan as Batman). The overall consensus of The New 52 was mixed, and a lot of people wanted the old Universe back, or at the very least, start making things like they were.

Rebirth was the 2016 initiation to do just that. Won't explain the story specific details, but know that a lot of characters that have been missing since the Reboot came back, Relationships and Costumes came back, and overall a sense of Time had passed that meant a lot of characters were married again.

Recommendations! *BATMAN: NEW 52 By Scott Snyder*. This is a 50 issue run and has its highs and lows, but this was the star of the New 52 for a while. It also acts as a great Satellite Book incase you want to jump over to The other Bat Family books.

*Geoff Johns's GREEN LANTERN Saga*. It's 10 years long, and it brought back the Green Lanterns into the spotlight.

Lois and Clark is a good one. All you need to know is that the Superman and Lois from the old Universe, before the Reboot, have made it to the new one and are living it out in secret, Raising their son.

GRAYSON. First Robin, Formerly Nightwing, Now secret Agent. Dick Grayson must go undercover and attempt to figure out what plans SPYRAL have. Very fun read.

TITANS HUNT (2015). It's one of the DC Books between New 52 and Rebirth, and basically brings back the Original Titan members again.

THE FINAL DAYS OF SUPERMAN.

DC UNIVERSE REBIRTH SPECIAL. This is where it begins. it's a massive 80 page one shot that sets up the Future of the DC Universe and what Rebirth has in store.

For Rebirth, I would suggest the following (NOTE: Pick up "Title Name": Rebirth and then the main title with the Rebirth banner)

SUPERMAN

TITANS (not Teen)

GREEN ARROW

RED HOOD AND THE OUTLAWS

HAL JORDAN AND THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS

WONDER WOMAN

DEATHSTROKE

Alternatively, if 10 years of Green Lantern is too much for you, you could instead go with GREEN LANTERNS (2016). It's meant as a jumping off point for new readers who don't know a lot about the Lantern mythos. Plus, 2 rookie lanterns!

6: I'd say the *New52* was a much harder reboot than *Rebirth* was. Characters like Superman and Wonder Woman, got all new backstories, and stories were erased from continuity. It was kinda a mess. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision.

*Rebirth* is about bringing back aspects of the pre-*Flashpoint* continuity, while altering character's continuity and backstories (such as Superman, Deathstroke and Wonder Woman).

---

6: The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

I wouldn't think of it as New 52 versus Rebirth. Just read the best titles of each:

- [**New 52** Recommended Reading Survey Results](http://i.imgur.com/Rhq72HB.jpg)
- [**Rebirth** Recommended Reading Survey Results](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV)

2: Skip to Rebirth.

> Well Rebirth is often undo what New 52 created. So if choose to read N52, you are probably read a story has been [retcon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=retcon) or has status it never happen.

---

8: Continuity wise, you could read the Rebirth books and be fine (it's meant to be a jumping on point for new readers anyway), but there are definitely some New 52 titles worth reading imo.

*Batman*, Batman and Robin, Grayson, Omega Men, Justice League, and *Swamp Thing* are all worth reading from the New 52.

---

18: Start anywhere you want. If you encounter something confusing, either keep reading comics until it makes sense or Google it. Here are some rankings of newer comics:

[Rebirth](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV) survey results (May 2017).

[New 52](http://imgur.com/Rhq72HB) survey results (February 2014).

8: Except for *Batman* and *Green Lantern*, "Rebirth" is more trur to DC characters, so I would start with Rebirth.

4: New 52 *Batman* and *Green Lantern* yes. Jeff Lemire's Green Arrow yes. Damian By Tomasi yes. Superman Lois and Clark yes. I would also check out Omega Men. There might be some others from the N52 era I am missing.

Rebirth has been killer top to bottom for the most part. The stuff I am reading is Superman from Tomasi, Super Sons from Tomasi, Green Arrow, Batman, Green Lanterns, All Star Batman. Only major complaint I have is that some stories are slow moving. Trinity, Justice League. For example.

6: Rebirth, no doubt. New 52 made me dislike reading DC comics. However, "Death of the Family" and "Night of the Owls" are amazing reads, you should check it out.

> 13: The New 52 Flash series (when Francis Manapul was on it) was REALLY good. As was *Scott Snyder's entire Batman run*, Geoff Johns Justice League run, King's Grayson, etc. And I can't forget John's Aqusman run, which helped redefine the character for a new age.
>
> The New 52 had a lot of bad (Like Teen Titans), but it also had a lot of good and great stories. It helped get A LOT of people back into comics, and DC wouldn't have the success it has now with Rebirth w/o it 
>
> > 3: I was surprised with how good Aquaman and Flash were. Unpopular opinion: Blue Beetle, Green Arrow and Batwing were actually decent (which was something I wasn't expecting). On the other hand, series like Teen Titans, Red Hood, Batwoman and many more were so disappointing...

3: The best thing in the New 52, hands down, was Brian Azarello's Wonder Woman. Other things are hit and miss. The DCYou stuff starting about 30 issues in got a bit better (Commish Gordon as a reluctant Batman was fun af).

Rebirth is all pretty good.

2: This is how i got into comics...

I would start with the New 52 but only the very best titles:

Aquaman by Geoff Johns

The Flash by Francis Manapul

*Batman by Scott Snyder*

*Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*

And maybe some other like Wonder Woman by Brian Azzarello and Justice League by Geoff Johns if you want.

Then if any of those characters in those stories interest you, i would go back and read some of their best Pre-Flashpoint stories.

Once you have done this i would start reading Rebirth. You can however, go straight from the New 52 to Rebirth and enjoy the great stuff Rebirth has been putting out so far but i will say that Rebirth (while great on its own) does not have nearly as big of an impact as it does if you know some of the Pre-Flashpoint history and characters (that doesnt mean all of it by any means as i know that might sound daunting but just some).

2: This is very good guide with best starting points and breef explanations of each one: https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/

1: Depends on who you want to start with. If you like Batman, his New 52 stories were pretty much all good so you could start there. If you wanted to start with someone like Superman or Green Arrow, then I would suggest starting with Rebirth because their N52 stories were a little shaky in terms of quality.

1: I'd say read *New 52 Batman*, GL, Flash, Forever Evil, and Grayson.

1: Rebirth but the New 52 might be worth reading for its Batman series.

1: Dedicate yourself to rebirth however go back and read some of the most popular stories from New 52.

Scott Synders batman run and Geoff John's Aquaman run are some of the best reads you can ask for.

1: Rebirth overall seems to be slightly higher quality. But n52 had a lot of great titles. For me *Swamp Thing* is a MUST read. Animal Man alongside it is great also. *Batman*, Action Comics, Wonder Woman and Flash were all solid and Justice League is good fun too!

### Conclusion on New 52 and Rebirth

#### General consensus on New 52

This was a mess. New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the DC business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision. Many characters were been defaced and reworked, many cool characters from the previous runs were deleted from the continuous such as Wally West. Plus, there was some **BAD** writing. 

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight. Although, some runs and books are worth attention: *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*. People say strange thing about New 52 Batman (Gordon as Batman, what?), but they also say that it's well written. By the way, many people say that New 52 is more darker than Rebirth.

#### General consensus on Rebirth

In general, it is was a step in right direction. DC continued New 52, but they returned old comic book spirit. N52 threw almost everything people cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**. New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2. Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and some people actually like that which I don't like.

> So, I will definitely read the best runs and stories from the New 52, but I don't think I will like Rebirth. According to the words, it sounds like a fan service.

**Recommend good Batman runs?** (Apr 12 2014)

Anybody recommend any good Batman runs starting with a certain issue where I can continue. Basically starting points.

I have pretty much read everything from **Grant Morrison's run** (Detective and Batman) and am currently catching up to *New 52* which will be done soon.

I'm also reading around the Infinite crisis era and getting to War Games, eventually it will all segue to *Morrison's run*.

Would love good Black Mask stories and more hard crime stories. Basically if I were to write a new Batman movie, which runs would you recommend?

Thanks!

EDIT: Have read most of the big graphic novels/mini series (**long halloween**, **year one**, **Dark Victory** etc)

3: Most runs that have an overarching plot-line have been collected into trades.

Besides *Snyder's work* in DC and Batman, my favorite writer's run would be Alan Grant's run on the Shadow of the Bat title. It's 1-82 in the title, but unfortunately most issues were never collected. The floppies are fairly common on eBay, and the few local comic shops I frequent have had multiple copies of almost all of the issues. Also, they're available on Comixology, if you prefer digital reading.

Doug Moench's second run on Batman in the '90s was fairly solid, though there were some real dud issues. It ran from 481- 559. His run with artist Kelley Jones was recently collected in [Batman by Doug Moench & Kelley Jones](http://www.amazon.com/Batman-Doug-Moench-Kelley-Jones/dp/1401247644). These are some of the better issues from his run.

**Loeb and Lee's run** on the Batman title resulted in **Hush**, one of my favorite stories. Their run covered issues 608 - 619, and has been collected in multiple formats. This also segues nicely into Judd Winick's run from Batman 635-650, with a brief hiatus on issues 642-644. This was collected in the Under the Hood trade.

Paul Dini (The Animated Series writer) had a nice run on the Detective Comics title. It was a bit sporadic, but was 821-824, 826-828, 831, 833-834, 837-841, 843-850, and 852.

Both Moench & Jones and Under the Hood has plenty of Black Mask action. In the Moench trade, Batman is hunting down Black Mask after the events of Knightfall. In Under the Hood, Black Mask has become one of the top gang bosses in Gotham.

There have been plenty of other great runs, but these are fresh in my mind, as I just finished Moench's complete run a few days ago.

> 3 (OP): woah thanks! Have read Hush and read a lot of Winick's run, sorta working backwards from Infinite Crisis. But thanks anyway, will check them out.

1: If you want crime stories you should check out Gotham Central. Batman is not the central figure (he shows up pretty often). Its the tale of working as a police officer in Gotham. They're some of my favorite Batstories.

1: Loeb / Sale **The Long Halloween** is a fantastic run.(that would make a great two parter or trilogy, let alone one film) No Black Mask, but a whole bunch others. Tells of the tale of a serial killer known as Holiday and his year long trail of holiday centric bodies

**Best Comic Runs** (May 20 2017)

As a big Batman fan, I'm almost ashamed to admit I haven't read any Batman comics.

I'm not made of money, but I'd like to get some solid Bat comics. I will be picking up the Rebirth series...

But other than that... I have been looking at **Court of Owls** and **Endgame**. I don't love older art styles of comics... but what are the top 3 or 5 runs in your opinions? I'll be picking up some tpb versions.

6: If you're reading on the cheap, checkout what the local libraries have. It's surprising how many comics they keep these days.

**Long Halloween**

**HUSH**

Batman: Detective by Paul Dini.

Those are my favs.

4: I was gonna say the early Finger/Kane stories lol but then I read the description.

***Grant Morrison's run**

*Denny O'Neil & Neil Adams

*Len Wein run

*The entire Frank Miller run (If you're really committed)

5: Batman - Vampire **Batman: The Long Halloween** All Star Batman & Robin Superman: Red Son

3: Since we're talking runs and not graphic novels, mini-series or one shot stories...

My top five would be:

- **Hush**
- *Snyder's New 52 run*
- **The Long Halloween**
- **The Black Mirror**
- Under the Red Hood

> 2 (OP): Appreciate all the responses so far...
>
> If you had to pick 3-5 trades to pick up for a bat fan...which would you recommend? Right now I'm leaning towards more modern stuff:
>
> **Court of Owls** as I heard that entire run was awesome
>
> Endgame because I heard this was an amazing story in the same run
>
> Rebirth vol 1
>
> Rebirth vol 2
>
> > 3: If I had to narrow it down to 3 (and considering that you like modern stuff), I'd go with **Hush**, **Death of the Family** and **The Black Mirror**.
> >
> > **Hush** still feels very modern and it's one of the best Batman stories ever. It's an example of what a Batman story should be.
> >
> > **The Black Mirror** is a fantastic detective story. It's Dick Grayson under the cowl, not Bruce, but I promise you it does not make the story less compelling. Very modern, Nolan-style feel to it.
> >
> > And **Death of the Family** is one of the best batman-Joker stories and it's set right after Court of Owls. You need to have read it to read Endgame (which I also loved, thought not as much). Endgame is a sequel to Death of the Family.
> >
> > Rebirth I can't really comment on. I'm behind. I'm not really into the reboot.
> >
> > > 1 (OP): So **court of Owls**, city of Owls, **death of the family** and endgame are the new 52 recs?
> > >
> > > > 1: There are also Zero Year and Superheavy.
> > > >
> > > > Zero Year came out between **Death of the Family** and **Endgame**, but it doesn't matter when you read it. It's an origin story for Batman. I'd recommend it as well.
> > > >
> > > > Superheavy is the very last thing written by *Snyder for the New 52* and it's set after **Endgame**. I haven't actually read it yet.

> > > >
> > > > - **Court of Owls**

> > > > > 2 (OP): Dark City and Secret City are the two Zero Year volumes?
> > > > >
> > > > > > 1: Correct.
> > > >
> > > > > 1: It seems *new 52 Batman* is very highly recommended by people as they say it's one of the best Bat runs ever...

> > **Year One**
> >
> > **Long Halloween**
> >
> > **Death in the Family** (not "of")
> >
> > **Killing Joke**
> >
> > All good ones to check out that are also touchstone stories that get referenced frequently either directly or by picking up story threads started in them.

2: Dude, read the original Detective Comics stories! They're... well, they'll help you understand all the best Batman stories. You'll get a ton of OG references that will otherwise fly over your head. Mostly, though, they'll help you understand who the Batman is and where he comes from. It's best to look up the actual entire issues and read some of the other comics in there, like Siegel & Shuster's Spy and their Slam Bradley series, to give you a better idea of why the Batman comic was created in the first place. My favorite revelation was that the Metropolis scene in Batman v. Superman was inspired by the same issue of Detective that gave us the first version of Batman's origin story. Did you know Bat-Man killed a person in almost every issue of Detective Comics? Read Batman #1 while you're at it. You wouldn't believe some of this stuff.

That's my recommendation.

**What is the most popular Batman run of all Time?**

I noticed that King's run has been polarizing and some people have ben saying that he writes batman poorly. Scott Snyder has the acclaimed **Court o Owls** story and the art propels the run to legendary status but after Death of the family the rest of the run is not regarded as high. Grant Morrison's run has been regarded by some reader has the best Batman run ever but others claim that it is a convoluted mess. So my question is which run is the most popular.

11: The most popular is probably *scott snyder* because his run was so recent and he's a big star at DC rn but **Grant Morrison** may have the best

> 4: I don't think so. It might be the most recommended but I think **Morrison's run** is more popular overall.
>
> > 3: By what metric?
> >
> > Certainly not sales or recommendations
> >
> > > 6: Ehh <u>by overall recommendations</u>, yeah. When new readers are trying to get into Batman, I usually see Snyder recommended (Since he started he's in continuity and Morrison technically isn't) but when people ask for overall best runs, I usually see Morrison's name a little more.

11: Among older fans, definitely O'Neil and Adams.

5: Outside of Miller and Moore? **Hush**, probably. It was a year-long run on the Batman ongoing.

> 2 (OP): I don't believe Moore or Miller had runs. Did they? They wrote Batman comics but they didn't have runs.
>
> > 1: I was referring to **DKR** and **Killing Joke**. Though **Year One** was technically a four-issue run in Batman.
> >
> > > 1 (OP): I figured you were taking about those. Still I mean long runs.

> 2: **Hush** is an arc, **killing joke** is a large one shot or graphic novel, and miller’s stuff are mini/maxi series. Generally runs are considered to be an extended period of time on a character with multiple story arcs, and usually an overarching narrative over the course of the entire writer’s time on the said character.

3: Some run from way back in the day when comics were still selling hundreds of thousands to a million issues each.

4: Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are the very best.

3: *Snyder*, **Morrison**, or O'niel

> 1: I haven't read O'niel. I know he introduced Ra's al Ghul and his Batman was darker even before Miller. So yes he definitely should be included.

2: **H U S H**.

My local comic shop sells at least one **Hush** trade a week. The newest copy in the store was on its 18th printing. (and that's not counting the other Hush formats like absolute, deluxe, unwrapped) The highest printing I'd seen before that was Watchmen at 11.

It is one of the most recommended books for newbies, and because of that benefits from some nostalgia. We all remember our first.

1: *Snyder’s* is probably the most popular and most known to people outside of Reddit, but all of my money is on **Morrison**. His run is almost a 10/10, it has a few weak points but Batman R.I.P. And Batman and Robin are both strong 10/10’s

**Any Batman Runs Pre New 52 worth reading?**

So I saw that a bunch of Batman books were on sale and was wondering if there were any on sale that people would recommend? I've read over 50 issues of King's run and read about 4 volumes of *Snyder's*. I'm interested in something more crime based like **Black Mirror** and less Bat Godish. Although I also have a soft spot for the big 90's Bat Family and the Dixon era even though I've barely read any of it, so maybe that's worth looking? But yeah I haven't read much Batman pre New 52 so any recommendations are welcome :)



Someone has already recommended me Batman: Streets of Gotham and after having a look I'm definitely checking that series out.

16: Paul Dini's Detective Comics run is great but its trades, except for Heart of Hush, are not easy to find.

**Grant Morrison's Batepic** is widely considered to be one of the best Batman runs ever. But occasionally it gets pretty bombastic so if you're okay with that I'd say go for it.

> 2 (OP): After having a look at the Dini run I'm definitely give that one a read. But I think I'm gonna also give Morrison's a look.
>
> Just so I know. Where does that run start exactly, Is Batman and Son the first trade? Thanks for the recommendations also!
>
> > 2: Yeah, you start with Batman and Son. The new edition also includes The Black Glove story so be sure to get that edition.

6: I would read Death in the Family, **Hush**, and Under the Red Hood. All good reads.

5: Have you read the classics? **Year one**, **Long Halloween** etc? If not, get on it!

3: Steve Engelhart's run

2: If you want a good look at pre-Flashpoint Batman and Joker, there's no better option than [**The Man Who Laughs**](https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Man-Laughs-Ed-Brubaker/dp/1401216226/).

2: At one time Dixon was writing Detective Comics, Robin, Nightwing, and Birds of Prey. They all were pretty good runs. His runs end abruptly on all of them when he left for CrossGen.

I really enjoyed Doug Moench and Kelly Jones Run around the same time. There was an emphasis on horror/supernatural elements.

Also, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight has a ton of really good stories.

> 1 (OP): These are some really good recommendations, thank you! I think I'm gonna check out the Doug Moench and Kelly Jones run, looks really different and interesting.

**What are the best Batman runs? (Feb 24 2020 - pretty fresh)**

Looking for a really good batman comic run, preferably stuff I can find on Amazon. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!

2: 'THE DARK KNIGHT NEW-52' stories are really good.

'Knight Terrors'

'Mad'

'Golden Dawn'

are all really good, in terms of both art & story both.

2: Chuck Dixon

The *Scott Sntuer* one has no soul IMO

> 1 (OP): Fair enough. I've read **Court of Owls** and enjoyed that, what do you dislike about *Snyder*? Just curious
>
> > 2: To me the *Scott Snyder run* is what an A.I. would write about Batman. I dont see anything new or sensitive about it.
> >
> > > 1 (OP): Yeah that's fair enough, I can understand that

2: Dark Nights: Metal and the tie ins. Batman: White Knight and Batman: Earth One are also very good.

1: Scott Snyder - Greg Capullo (2011) and **Jeph Loeb - Jim Lee** (2002)

> 2 (OP): Thanks! I've read **Court of Owls** and Death of the family which I think is Snyder and Capullo.
>
> I've also read **Hush**, which I think is **Lee and Loeb**.
>
> Am I right in thinking that?
>
> > 1: Yes, you're right.

1: In addition to what others have already said (*Snyder* especially), I'm a big fan of Greg Rucka's run on Detective Comics, (which started with No Man's Land in 1999) and Ed Brubaker's run on Batman around the same time. Both of them, IRRC, also worked on Gotham Central about the GCPD which was excellent.

Going way back to the Bronze age, you can't overlook Adam's and O'Neil's work in the 70s, which essentially rescued Batman from campy silliness and created the dark knight we all love.

1: **Grant Morrison's Batman run** from Batman and Son through to Batman and Robin #16 is the best run on the character ever, imo.

Knightfall is an excellent arc that perfectly does the "hero replaced by 'cooler' version" arc. While the amount of onscreen Bruce Wayne is fairly limited, there is never any doubt in the reader's mind who the only true Batman is.

**Batman Year One** is still the gold standard for "Batman origin stories" and if you're a fan of Batman Begins, it's definitely worth a look.

**The Long Halloween** is a terrific standalone story arc that takes place in Batman's first year.

**Batman: Hush** is probably the most fun comic ever made. Bombastic, colourful, full of characters and featuring the (imo) best Batman artist of all time, Jim Lee.

Batman: Son of the Demon. A short but extremely well told story that features a more human and emotional side of the Bat.

If you want a really long arc, then I recommend No Man's Land, which (arguably) starts at Contagion, and continues through Legacy, Cataclysm, Road to NML and then NML proper. Very much worth the time and effort, though.

1: Dini's Detective Comics run. (Detective, Death and the City, Private Casebook, Resurrection of Ra's Al Ghul, Heart of Hush)

Detective Comics #821-#850

Unfortunately, they're harder to find physical versions of nowadays. I got mine off of eBay. But if you have DC Universe app you can read them there on the cheap.

A lot of one-shot stories, but so good. He really captures the same writing style of the Animated Series.

---

21: If you like a dark story with a twist, try **The Long Halloween** and its sequel, **Dark Victory**.

11: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory** (sequel to TLH), **Hush**, Under The Red Hood, **Black Mirror**, and **The Court of Owls**.

> Someone: I really enjoyed Zero Year as a starting point. **Year One** is a different comics.

8: The right answer is always **The Court of Owls** (The New 52) for new readers. It's the perfect starting point.

> **Court of Owls** is pretty dark IMO. # analyzing the comments, I can tell you that's not exactly true.

---

For a starter I would say read Batman **Year One** or the **Killing Joke**. Basically the greats. After that it's pretty much a pick your own buffet. My personal favorites are no mans land (Batman helping Gotham in a huge earthquake) , **The Court of Owls** (new villians. As namesake) , the world's finest (Batman and Superman team up, its nothing like the movies )

> Watching or reading **Batman: Year One** first? - I'm biased due to **Year One** being one of my favorites, but I say read it first. Its not duper long, but it's fantastic. Just a warning though, it's just as much a Gordon story as a Batman one.

Edit: there was one comic or short that was damn good, it was about Batman's psyche and it ended with Batman in a sewer who could not let go of his guns.

I really recommend you to read it if anyone can help identify it.

---

6: Have a go at grant Morrison’s Arkham asylum and Alan Moore’s **the killing joke**. Both dark, and the art ok Arkham asylum is awesome.

> Edit: killing joke not man who laughs.
>
> Right after that, please, please, please read Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns.

5: Must reads are **Killing Joke** by Alan Moore and **Hush** by Jeph Loeb, both are extremely dark and the best batman books to date in my opinion. If you don't mind a Dick Grayson Batman, try **Black Mirror** as well, it is extremely dark.

4: **The Dark Knight Returns** is about a Batman who come out of retirement because Gotham’s gone to hell. He’s unleashed, uncappable of holding back. It’s absolutely amazing. Skip watching the animated movies until you’ve read the comic. It’s only four issues.

---

7: **The Court of Owls** is where I would start. It's modern and one of the best Batman stories ever. It's volume 1 of Scoot Snyder's Batman. If you like it, it runs for like 8 volumes.

You are going to get a lot of recommendations for **Year One** and **The Dark Knight Returns**. They are considered Batman classics, but IMO they don't hold up extremely well.

**The Long Halloween** is another one you can jump into without much knowledge of Batman. It's sequel is **Dark Victory**.

3: All New 52. **Killing Joke**. **Year One**. **The Dark Knight Returns**. Batman: The White Knight. **Batman Hush**. **Batman The Black Mirror**. Batman Death in the Family. Batman Under the Hood

2: **Batman Year One**. **The dark knight returns** **The long Halloween** **The killing joke** **Dark Victory** **Grant Morrison’s Batman run** *Scott Snyder’s Batman Run*

> EDIT: also Batman Earth One by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank.

---

**Suggest me some really dark comics, especially related to batman. Really really dark**

8: For Batman:

Arkham Asylum, Dark Knights: Metal, One Shots **Dark Knight Returns**

Non-Batman:

**Watchmen**, Invisibles, **Swamp Thing** (Alan Moore), **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman).

5: *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. **Dark Knight Returns**, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

4: None of the other posts got *really* dark, apart from the Arkham book. Here’s a list of truly dark Batman books.

- Batman and Dracula: Red Rain.
- Batman: Bloodstorm.
- Batman: Crimson Mist.
- Batman: Haunted Knight.
- Batman Annual No. 15: “The Last Batman Story”.
- Robin Vol. 4 No. 46.
- Batman No. 547.
- Batman: Last Arkham.
- Adventures of Superman Annual 1994: The Super Seven part I.
- Superboy Annual 1994: The Super Seven part II.

**What is the darkest Batman comic out there?**

Specifically looking for something dark to read with blood and all the goods. Would like to start from #1 as apposed to reading a random bloody comic. Thanks

13:

Now what do you mean by "dark?"

All-Star Batman and Robin is pretty damn dark in tone and content - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though.

> As a dark and serious Batman story, I also wouldn't recommend *All Star Batman & Robin*...
>
> ...HOWEVER as a farcical, crazy-town, banana-pants story I wholly recommend *All Star Batman & Robin.*

Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth by Morrison is <u>probably the darkest you'll find</u>. It is pretty much all psychological and is fairly light on the blood but it is probably the most all-out horror batman story there is.

The Black Glove contains the issue *Joe Chill in Hell* where Batman mentally tortures Joe Chill into committing suicide - that's pretty dark.

Dark Knight/Dark City was recently re-released I hear and is probably the most grim Riddler story out there... it starts of pretty dark and stays that way. Got some baby kidnapping and it is generally pretty creepy.

**Killing Joke** has implied rape, house invasion, execution and general mental torture so that's pretty dark.

**Black Mirror** has a lot of psychological darkness and detective work to it and some torture and mutilation too.

Pretty much any ark from the pre 2008ish series Streets of Gotham would be about some pretty grim subjects - it was an uneven series.

---

**What are some of the darkest batman stories other than Killing Joke and TDKR**

10: Read Scott Snyder's Batman run. Or **The Long Halloween**, maybe *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On A Serious Earth*? It's probably harder to find "lighter" Batman stories haha

6: Snyder's Works: **Black Mirror**, **Court of Owls**, City of Owls, **Death of the Family**, **Endgame**.

Geoff Johns: Batman: Earth One Vol. 1 & 2.

Other's: Death in the Family, Arkham Asylum, **Long Halloween**.

3: Aside from all the mentioned and you're also interested in the animated universe, Return of the Joker's pretty grim.

5: Night Cries

City of Crime

The Cult

Gothic

3: Death In The Family

#### Batman and Joker

**What are the best Batman tpbs with the Joker?**

> I think tpbs means Thought Provoking Bible Studies.

11: I know there are mixed feelings on the arc in this sub, but Snyder’s **Death of the Family** (New 52 Batman Vol. 3) got some pretty stellar reviews and is my personal favorite Joker storyline.

10: **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, Batman and Joker’s first meeting.

6: **Death of the Family** and **Endgame**. **The Man who Laughs**.

---

**Comics that dive into Batman and Joker’s relationship/psychology**

**Well known:**

- **The Killing Joke**

- *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*

  > In other thread: *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. Dark Knight Returns, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

- **A Death in the Family**

- **The Man Who Laughs**

**Underrated:**

- Gotham Central: Soft Targets (Frankly, all of Gotham Central is amazing and you should read it)
- Fool's Errand (Detective Comics #726)
- Joker: Devil's Advocate
- Batman and Robin: Batman & Robin Must Die (big bonus points because it's not actually Bruce and the Joker...but *Dick!Bats* and the Joker), though I'd recommend reading the previous volumes of the run first

**Other:** *Scott Snyder's run on Batman*, particularly **Death of the Family** and **Endgame**. I'm not going to comment either way on Snyder's Joker stories; I think they're worth reading and well-written, and there's some quite interesting and worthwhile commentary on the Batman-Joker relationship in them, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say they're "underrated" or the best Batman-Joker stories of all time.

#### Joker

*Comics:*

- **The Man Who Laughs**
- **The Killing Joke** (seems to be the most relevant to what the upcoming Joker film is going for)

(I haven’t read ”Death in the Family” yet, so I didn’t list it, but I heard it’s a classic. I also heard “**Death *of* the Family**” is very good, and there’s a DC Essential Edition of it coming up)

There’s also “The Three Jokers” coming up by Geoff Johns.

*Films:*

- Batman (1989)
- The Dark Knight (2008)
- Under the Red Hood (an animated film that revolves around the aftermath of “Death in the Family”)

*Video Games:*

- The Arkham Trilogy (even in Knight, the Joker plays a big role).

> Someone: 
>
> Joker by Azzarello is good.
>
> Death of the Family by Snyder and Capullo is probably my favorite.
>
> The last one is collected into a single volume that makes it easier to read for a guy who's not big into comics, as you said.

---

I loved Batman: White Knight personally - definitely recommend you read it. You may also like some of the New 52 stuff (**Death of The Family** is the one you hear most often but chronologically I'm not sure where it's placed).

> The New 52 is Death **of** the Family, which I agree is really good. A Death **in** the Family is the post-crisis story, that I find terrible. Just wanted to clear it up for OP.

---

**What is your favorite joker story?**

You should probably add '*besides the Killing Joke*' because well obviously.

> Then the obvious answer would be "The Laughing Fish".

**Endgame**.

If I were to choose something besides **The Killing Joke** or "The Laughing Fish", it would be "Dreadful Birthday, Dear Joker".

After **The Killing Joke**, **The Man Who Laughs**.

---

**What is the DARKEST Joker story in the Batman comics?**

20: If you don't think the Joker from *Snyder and Capullo's New 52 run* is dark and twisted enough, then I don't know what's wrong with you. That's the most sadistic version I've seen yet.

> **Death of the Family** and **Endgame** from New 52 focus on Joker, and they're both great.

> The entire *Snyder New 52 run* of Batman is fantastic.

20: **Death of the Family**, **Endgame**, **The Killing Joke**, Brian Azzarello's Joker, **The Man Who Laughs**.

8: Obvious answer is **The Killing Joke** but I think Brian Azzarello's 'Joker' graphic novel is even more unsettling, especially the scene with Frost's ex-wife.

> Joker by Brian Azzerello is fantastic.

---

**Joker Comic Reading List**

My number 1 personal recommendation is **The Killing Joke** its widely considered to be one of the best joker stories out there and in my opinion is the best. It was the first comic book I read and what hooked me on the character so I may be biased in this regard but I really can't think of a better jumping off point for a new comic book reader in general or a new batman reader or just a new reader to the Joker. Writer Alan Moore gives a gripping and terrifying story focusing more on the Joker then Batman while also exploring one of the possible origin stories for the character all in all it's one of the best characterizations out there along with Brian Bollands beautiful artwork it becomes a must-read for Joker fans.( just make sure to get the deluxe edition which was published years later and includes updated coloring that improves the quality of the whole book even more most comic book shops will exclusively sell the deluxe edition so it shouldn't be a problem but just in case I should mention it if you're not experience with comics)

Next down from that is **Death Of The Family** ( not to be confused with death in the family which is the story of how Jason Todd the second Robin was murdered by the Joker it's an iconic story and undoubtedly an important event in Batman mythos however I personally am not fond of the overall storyline finding it a bit sloppy but feel free to check it out for yourself at your local library or read couple panels at a bookstore and decide) admittedly the new 52 provided a lot of controversial storylines that divided the fan base, however Scott Snyder set out to write a horror story set in the universe of Batman and did so expertly by putting him up against the Joker with the stakes higher than they've ever been. In the start of the new 52 the Joker vanished from Arkham Asylum leaving his face sliced off and nail to wall this story picks up one year later where the Joker is back and has stolen his face back to wear like a mask. Somewhere in the demented brain of his he has come to the conclusion that all of Batman's allies are wearing him down and preventing him from being the best superhero he can be so he decided the only logical conclusion is to take them out one by one this is a massive crossover event between multiple comics that when collected together is genuinely chilling and provides an excellent cross section of the jokers personality as well as giving an excellent look into the relationship between Batman and the Joker. Along with that Greg Capullos art renders the whole thing beautifully horrifying( side note since this is a crossover between multiple publications what you don't want to do is buy a trade paperback of one and wound up with a fifth of the story. On the cover it should say the name of the publication along with the title. Ie. Catwoman- Death of the family. Most comic book shops if you say that you want the entire collected storyline they will be able to provide you with it just in case I bought my copy of Barnes and Noble and to be recognizable this edition has a cover printed with Joker- death of the family. As the title.)

Next isn't really Joker story per se however it does feature the Joker and is a very memorable storyline **The Dark Knight Returns** by Frank Miller is regarded in the comic book world as being one of the greatest comic books ever written as it brought Batman back to his dark roots. In this story it takes place 10 years in the future where Batman is 60 years old and retired however he comes out of retirement to save Gotham City along the way his coming out of retirement will awaken several supervillains have lain dormant including the Joker who returns to have a little fun and put a stop to batman and also super man who is working for the government who comes to odds with Batman in the climax of the story. Again while not featuring The Joker as the prominent focus of the story it does give an excellent cross-section into Batman's personality and one cannot truly understand one without the other. In addition this is going to be the inspiration for the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie will draw from prominently. (Disclaimer the art style of Frank Miller is somewhat of an acquired taste and is perhaps not the best first impression for inexperienced readers.)

one I can think of right now is **Endgame** which also written by Snyder with the same art as the the death of the family is the follow up to the death of the family signaling the return of the Joker after those events and exploring yet another possible origins for him however keeping in history with the Joker they never actually give a concrete yes or no as to what his origin story is always keeping a moving target admittedly I have not read the story myself however I have heard that it is entertaining for my local comic book store and will undoubtedly give it a read ( side note I would not recommend this starting off not only because of the fact that it is a follow up to a different book but also the controversial nature of the story which divided the fan base yet again read a couple other of these stories and come back to this one after you've read and liked DOTF)

Simply titled **Joker** by Brian Azzarello tell the story of the Joker being released from prison and his ride back to power with Gotham's underworld told from the point of view of one of his goons Johnny frost. This story in particular is unique because it never actually shows Batman. It does however show the brutal nature of the Joker and his unstable personality from the outsiders pov giving readers a look in. Because this story is set outside of ordinary continuity the writers were free to explore the character in a new way. The unique art style is done less like a comic drawing and more like oil paintings showcasing several iconic Batman villains. If you enjoyed Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character in The Dark Knight this one is definitely for you as he drew heavily from this graphic novel as inspiration from everything to his general appearance to the way in which the character interacts with the supporting characters.

Lastly is "**The Man Who Laughs** written as a follow up to a year one which was the origin story of Batman this story is essentially a retelling of a classic story from 1940 the one in which Batman first comes to head with the Joker. Now I personally like this story purely because of its principal taking a story that nobody will realistically get to read unless they come for 75 years of comics updating the art style to a more modern setting and sending it back out I really can't say anymore about this book but if you're looking for a good Joker story this is definitely one to check out.

Side note please keep in mind that this is a character with a 75 year lineage and that his character has been told many times by many different authors so there are hundreds of storylines graphic novels and trade paperbacks that feature him as the main character that I am probably leaving out these are only the ones that I have read and enjoyed this being my favorite character. So I encourage you if there's a comic book store near you to go and just check out the rack of Joker comics there and see if any of them strike your fancy but this list should be more than enough to get you started.

#### Harley Quinn

**Batman: Mad Love**. I feel like it's the only good Harley comic. I personally think she hasn't been that great since B:TAS, but that's just me. Batman Adventures: My Boyfriend's Back and A Wedding to Die For are also gems.

Harley and Ivy is also a lot of fun but it's nothing serious. Her Pre New 52 solo run was okay until the team changed and then it became unbearable.

In the New 52 she has gone through so many changes, in one issue she was killing 20 kids with bombs, in another she was shown with puppies and being a sweetheart. The New 52 Suicide Squad run was atrocious imo, and Palmiotti and Conner write her as Deadpool basically with same randomness and insanity.

### Daredevil

**Where to start with Daredevil comics?**

Im very interested in frank millers run but I have no idea where to start, I know I want to read born again but there is stuff before. I also get kinda confused from other lists so please make it simple! Many thanks

7: Definitely read **Frank Miller’s**- **The Man without Fear**- first. It’s amazing.

2: There's Miller/Janson collection that covers the best of the early 80s run. Start there.

Then **Born Again**

Then **Man Without Fear**

All brilliant stories with sublime art.

> 3: Theres also Daredevil: Love & War, also by Miller. And i'd check out his Elektra material too; Assassin, Lives Again.
>
> > 2: All good choices too. Then you’ve got a litany of riches with Nocenti/JRJR’s 90s run, the Bendis/Maleev run, Brubaker’s run, and Waid’s run (although Waid takes it a different direction totally). DD has been one of the most consistent titles in the Marvel line, imo.
> >
> > > 1: 
> > >
> > > > Nocenti/JRJR’s 90s run
> > >
> > > I'm happy to not to be the guy in this case. I'm glad others know how great Nocenti was on DD in the late 80s early 90s.
> > >
> > > I would also throw in the DG Chiechster run that proceeded Nocenti

1: This is the guide I used to start reading **Daredevil**, the only arc I didnt enjoy that much was Fall From Grace (it was the 90s though everything during that time is kinda bad)

[www.comicbookherald.com/daredevil-reading-order/amp/](http://www.comicbookherald.com/daredevil-reading-order/amp/)

1: Read **Man without Fear** first like others have suggested. Then, **Frank Miller's first run** is collected in 3 trades. After that, read **Born Again**. From there, I would read Guardian Devil followed by Bendis's run. The reading order is pretty straightforward from there on out.

1: I started with **Born Again**. You can if you want. Or go back to the start of **Miller’s stuff**, which everyone has given reading orders for

1: **Miller** (158-191, **Born Again**, **Man Without Fear**) -> Smith -> **Bendis** -> *Brubaker* -> Waid

---

**Where to start with Daredevil?**

I just finished binge-watching Season 2 of Daredevil. I'm already very into comic books but for some reason I never got around to reading any Daredevil titles except Daredevil Yellow by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, which I enjoyed very much.

I'm looking for some recommended reading on him. I appreciate any help. Thanks.

11: You should check out the **Bendis** and *Brubaker* run, the **Frank Miller stuff**, and the recent Mark Waid run. Soule's current series is pretty great too. Daredevil often attracts great talents.

Edit: To clarify each run is a great jumping on point but the chronological order of the series goes **Frank**, **Bendies**/*Brubaker*, Waid, Soule. There are others in between but they aren't as prolific.

> 7: This. I have never read **Miller's run** (always wanted to) but to me the **Bendis/Maleev** run (and what *Brubaker* follows it with) <u>is quintessential Daredevil</u>. Cannot recommend it enough. The art is spectacular and it's among **Bendis**' best writing I think.
>
> > 3: Yea you should definitely read Millers stuff. I'm not even a huge fan of his work, but his Daredevil is masterful.
> >
> > > 1:
> > >
> > > > I'm not even a huge fan of his work...
> > >
> > > This is pretty much why I haven't yet. I liked Year One, didn't care for DKR, but I did like All-Star Batman (maybe more for the novelty of it, if that makes sense rather than his writing standing out). I will check it out!
> > >
> > > > 7: As someone who only likes his Year One out of his other work, his DD is great. Get the reprinted omni and the companion out in a couple of weeks
> > >
> > > > 3: I find the majority of his initial DD run a little dated, but there are some superb stories in it, particularly Bullseye vs Elektra and Roulette. His second run, Darevil: Born Again, is my favourite thing he's ever written and probably my favourite Daredevil story.
> > >
> > > > 2: The great thing about Miller's run is you see the transition of cheesy daredevil to the daredevil we now know. The first volume is super cheesy that really dates the book. Then half way through volume 2 it changes. It gets dark and heavy and one of my all time favorite individual comics is in that volume. It hits you hard. And volume 3 sets the tone for pretty much exactly what you expect a modern day daredevil comic to be like.
> > >
> > > > 1: Daredevil is Frank Miller's greatest work in my opinion. I can't stand the guy usually but he really nailed it with Daredevil.

> 3: I also think Ann Nocenti's run deserves to be mentioned. I think she followed Frank Millers run and did a really good job.
>
> > 2: Just a clarification for anybody who's put off hearing Ann Nocenti's name, she might not be very well thought of nowadays but back in the day she was a pretty legit writer, and her Daredevil run really is quite good.

10: Go on Comixology today, big sale.

I'm personally partial to the **Frank Miller**/John Romita Jr "**Daredevil: Man Without Fear**" 5 issue mini.

Daredevil Season 1 borrowed heavily from this.

There are lots of great places to start though, so don't get too hung up on finding the "right" spot.

5: Start with **Frank Miller's stuff**. From there, go to *Bendis*, then *Brubaker*, then Waid. End on Soule's current run.

5: **Miller**, then **Bendis**, then *Brubaker* then Waid then Soule

2: For something a little more lighthearted Mark Waid's run is pretty great but tonally it is quite different from the show. I'd just recommend it because it's fairly self contained and has a lot of great moments between Matt and Foggy.

> 2 (OP): Hey, I actually just started Waid's run because of recommendations on this thread and I'm really liking the tone of it!

---

**Best Daredevil run**

I’m currently caught up on the current Daredevil run. Wondering which I should read next. Any suggestions?

6: In order of best to least, IMO:

**Frank Miller** (1980-1983, 1986, 1993)

**Brian Bendis** (2001-2006)

Mark Waid (2011-2015)

Ann Nocenti (1986-1991)

*Ed Brubaker* (2006-2009)

Roger McKenzie (1978-1980)

Kevin Smith (1998-1999)

The rest of the runs, including Stan Lee's, are pretty bad (Not including Soule's yet).

4: No love for the Kevin Smith run?

> 2: Eh, kind of forgot about it. 8 issues is not much of a run. But I edited my list and added him last. His run was still better than Stan's and Gerry Conway's. Wolfman's and Shooter's runs are not bad, but just unmemorable. Wolfman created Bullseye, though. Shooter, Paladin.

> The biggest run I left off was D. G. Chichester's. Almost a decade of Daredevil. But his run was OK when I first read it, and really bad whenever I try to revisit. Too "90s" I suppose, and I love me SOME 90s comics.
>
> The best things Chichester wrote was the Shadowline, and bringing Terror over into the MU from there.

5: **Millers run** is classic but I think **Bendis' run** is the best overall because as good as the stories were, one thing most people don't talk about is just how good Alex Maleev's art is on it. I'm actually re-reading the run now and sometimes I turn the page and still say "Whoah" at some of his splashes.

Also, Kevin Smith's run (vol2, #1-8) is only an 8 issue arc ("Guardian Devil") but I think it is important to read for for several reasons:

-This DD relaunch is often credited as being instrumental in bringing Marvel back from bankruptcy (and thereby a turning point in the industry following the mid 90s crash). It's a great piece of history to read.

-Quesada pencils in top form. Some of the details and borders he added to splash and title pages are beautiful.

-The death of an important figure in DD history.

-It set the tone for an excellent crop of stories and writers in the 00s by taking a weak/forgotten/joke villain and giving him teeth. Oh and what a reveal it was.

-oh yea, it's really good.

3: Mark Waid's run on Daredevil is pretty good IMO!

2: I'll rank what I've read (from amazing to OK, imo):

2: 1 - **Bendis** and **Miller** on equal footing - **Miller** has the better high points but **Bendis**' is a lot more consistent.

2 - Waid

3 - Nocenti

4 - *Brubaker*

5 - Smith

6 - Loeb

1: Daredevil

For reference, this list was originally written in 2014 and I update it from time to time and post it wherever I think it would be helpful.

So you wanna read some Daredevil? You're fortunate as there have been some excellent DD runs, many over the past decade.

**Entry Level Daredevil Reading:**

For the classics stories and Matts Origin, I recommended the following:

You could start with the **Frank Miller run**. "**Born Again**" is regarded as one of the quintessential DD story lines. It's got a great story backed up by some great art. You could also start with "The Man Without Fear" mini series also by Miller (art by Romita Jr.) which was a 1990's modern retelling of Matt Murdock's origins. You could also start with Daredevil Yellow by Jeff Loeb, which is also a good modern retake on the origin story. I would skip DD Season One, however. I can't even remember the creative team behind it, so that reaffirms (to me) that it isn't vital reading.

**Late 90's to Mid 2006 Marvel Knights - Kevin Smith, David Mack & Brian Michael Bendis**

Daredevil was relaunched in the late 90's under the Marvel Knights banner with a brand new #1. Kevin Smith started the volume off with an 8 issue run that is pretty good and changes a few important things in the DD universe. Joe Quaseda does the art, which is also rad. After that it leads into the Brian Michael Bendis/ Alex Maleev run. This is my personal favorite DD run. The team of Bendis and Maleev (as well as art of some issues by David Mack) is a wonderful one. They are both excellent comic creators (I don't care what anyone says about Bendis, his DD work is tip top!) who create a masterpiece together. This series has dark and gritty writing with a very complimentary art style. I simply could not recommended this series enough. I've talked it up to my friends that have no real interest in comics; and especially not Daredevil as a character (thank Fox for the film that left a bad taste in everyones mouth) that ended Up loving it. In regards to the Bendis run; I feel like you don't realize when you've fallen in love with it. You start reading it and it just sucks you in; its tip top reading. Get on it!

2016 edit: With the runaway success of the Netflix TV series, I definitely think this is a great entry series for any new DD readers, especially if you want a great Matt vs Fisk story.

**2006 to 2010 - Ed Brubaker & Andy Diggle**

After the Bendis run comes the fantastic work by Ed Brubaker. His run picks up right where Bendis leaves off, so you really should read the previous stories first. It's all one story, so read it all! Brubaker takes the character of Daredevil in a new direction. It's more of an action/adventure type of book where as Bendis was more of a gritty crime/mob style story. Both are great, I just happen to like the former much more. The art for the Brubaker run is pretty solid too, with great art by Michael Lark. The numbering goes back to the original numbering during this run, mainly to commemorate the 500th issue of Dardevil. The numbering remains this way until the book was relaunched a few years later.

Now here is where most fans will tell you the writing slips a little. Andy Diggle takes over after Brubaker, and just like his predecessor he takes Matt in a new direction while also continuing on with story elements that were planted by Brubaker. Diggle tells a story that focuses on more of a magic/spiritual/mystical Asian inspired kind of book. It's pretty dark for the most part. A lot of people will tell you to skip this, and while I do consider it to be VERY necessary reading, I can agree to an extent because the writing wasn't great. At the very least you should read up on it on Wikipedia. It ties directly into "Shadowland" which was a crossover event that focused on the street level heroes (Spidey, Moonknight etc.) with Daredevil as the primary antagonist. That's right, *antagonist*. Like I said, I consider it to be vital reading.

Once Shadowland ends, the book turns into "Black Panther: The Man Without Fear". Without spoiling too much, BP is taking care of Hells Kitchen for Matt for a little while. You don't need to read this, but I quite enjoyed it myself. It's written by David Liss with some Rotating artists. There's only 12ish issues to read if this here and it's a pretty interesting story. It goes into Fear Itself, and I found that arc to be very good. Around this time there was a mini series (also written by Diggle) called "Daredevil Reborn", not to be confused with Millers' Born Again. This series is only 4 issues and I found it to be the best of Diggles DD stories. It bridges the gap between Shadowland and the next volume, so I definitely recommends reading it. It's a a nice end to the previous few years worth of Daredevil stories.

**2011 to 2015 Marvel Now! - Mark Waid & Chris Samnee**

Next comes the Mark Waid run launching with a brand new #1 and new Volume. In general, Mark Waid's run has received nothing but critical acclaim. Like the writers before him, Waid takes Matt on a new journey and new direction. This run is a little more upbeat and campy than any other Daredevil book I've ever read. I can understand why some people might not like that kind of thing, but I feel like Matt has faced so many hardships and so much tragedy in his life that he can certainly do with some more upbeat and happier moments. There's still plenty of dark twists and turns in this run, but in comparison to the others (Especially Miller and Bendis) this is like watching an episode of Sesame Street. The art is great too! There have been a few spectacular artists that have chipped I got this run (Marcos Martin, Paolo Rivera, Mike Allred spring to mind) but the standout is Chris Samnee. Waid and Samnee have made this book so enjoyable, they've got a fantastic control of the character. That run ends at issue 36 but is relaunched right away with ANOTHER new #1 and new Volume for All New Marvel Now. This particular volume credits both Waid and Samnee as the storytellers, they really made it their own. Sadly, this run has now ended. This is my second favorite Daredevil run after Bendis'.

**2015 to Present All New All Different Marvel - Charles Soule**

After the status quo change of Secret Wars, the book was relaunched in 2015 with another #1, this time by Charles Soule and Ron Garney. At this moment in time, I've only read a handful of issues from this series and I can't really judge it by what I have read. I definitely liked the first two issues, but I'm like 10 books behind and have some catching up to do before I can give a fair opinion. I've read a lot of people say it's a drastic change in tone compared to Waids run, but that will be good for anyone who didn't love the previous run as much as someone like myself.

The current run looks to be going strong, and in Feb 2017 when it reaches issue 17 there will be three new books (for Elektra, Bullseye and Kingpin respectively) launching for the new year, all of which will expand upon the current Daredevil world.

*August 2017 update: * I still haven't read them yet... I HAVE them, but I'm lazy. I even just bagged and boarded all the single issues late week.

*October 2017 update:* I still haven't read them yet.... still... I'm very, very behind. From what I can tell only Daredevil is still running as of the start of Marvel Legacy. The original numbering will return again with issue 595, so expect to see a big 600th issue very soon! Charles Soule is still the writer, he'll be joined by Stefano Landini on art duties.

**EXTRAS**

You could also check out "Dardevil: End of Days" by Bendis and Maleev. It was great to see these two take 'ol Hornhead for a spin again. This book can be considered to be Daredevils "The Dark Knight Returns". It's a future story that is *meant* to be canon. I liked it. It was dark and enjoyable and just really great to have this duo behind the wheel of an, albeit very different kind of, Daredevil series. I mention this series last because it's meant to be the last Dd story. Judge it for yourself.

I hope you find these recommendations to be helpful. Happy reading!

**Best Daredevil Runs?**

I've only ever actually read **Frank Miller's original run** and Waid's run and want to get more into Daredevil, so what runs of Daredevil do you suggest or enjoyed yourself?

19: **Bendis/ Maleev** - Daredevil Volume 2 #27-81

*Brubaker*/ (mostly) Lark - Daredevil Volume 2 #82-112 and Daredevil Volume 1 #500.

Some people think Kevin Smith had a decent run too (Volume 2 #1-8), I am not such a fan though.

> 8: I'd still say the events of Smiths run are quite important to *Bendis's* and it's a short read so I'd pick it up aswell.

9: How has no one mentioned **Miller-Mazzuchelli**?

> 6: I don't know if it counts as a "run" since it's only one story, but **Born Again** is essential, and in my opinion, the best Daredevil Story there is.

8: Ann Nocenti gets some love for her Daredevil being the best post Miller and pre Marvel Knights imprint.

Kevin Smith and Joe Quesada then began the Marvel Knights imprint of Daredevil with Guardian Devil and brought the character back to the forefront and decompressed storytelling was becoming popular at this time.

**Brian Michael Bendis** did a short story with David Mack before taking over the title with Alex Maleev. **Bendis and Maleev's run** is very comparable to **Frank Miller's** run with Klaus Janson with a huge focus on the crime in the city.

*Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark* followed **Bendis** and Maleev's run and is of comparable quality although even darker in tone.

I think **Frank Miller** is the best Daredevil writer but **Bendis** isn't far behind while Maleev is Daredevil's best artist. *Brubaker's run* is great but not as memorable for me after his first story arc.

6: The Ann Nocenti run (issues 236-291) is to me in the top 5 runs ever as far as Daredevil goes, especially when she was working with Romita Jr. She really did some new and crazy things but it never felt too out of place.

4: I'd recommend Smith -> Mack -> *Bendis* -> *Brubaker*

5: Everything from **Miller's run** forward is worth reading. It's lowest point is good and the highest point is legendary.

**Good Daredevil run to read?**

With Daredevil being one of my favourite heroes i feel like i haven't read much about him, i've mainly always read Spidey. However with the void the Netflix cancellation has left me i want to read some Daredevil comics. I always hear "Born Again" is good but it is really hard to find here in the UK both in store and online.

Any recommendations?

8: **Miller**, **Bendis**, *Brubaker*, Waid, Soule, Kevin Smith, and Nocenti's runs.

9: The easiest place to begin is, imo, **Bendis**. The greatest modern run of the character.

> 4: Yeah if you want *a lot* of reading, then start with Bendis and keep going until you get to the end of Soule's run. It's pretty consistently fantastic minus one particular run (Digle's...). Be aware that we're talking about almost two decades worth of comic books, but if you get sucked in you might burn through them faster than you think.
>
> If you want a smaller commitment, Waid's run is more recent and it's awesome on its own. It leads to Soule's run chronologically, but narratively the link is pretty thin. Soule's it's also good by the way.
>
> Alternatively, you can wait for Zdarsky to pick up the mantle. The first issue of his run is due in a month or two.
>
> > 1:

> > > If you want a smaller commitment, Waid's run is more recent and it's awesome on its own

> > >
> > > I agree with both of you. The first half was great, maybe the greatest quality run on DD in consecutive 25 issues since Miller. However, the second half (SF part) was pretty bad and kept going off the rails.

5: The recent Mark Waid run is excellent. It's much more light-hearted than a lot of other Daredevil stories and the Chris Samnee art is top notch.

5: Any run of Daredevil can satisfy you. Story wise he might be the most consistent Marvel hero IMHO.

3: Start with classic **Miller**. So much of what you know about the iconic Daredevil is from this run.

Then **Bendis** and *Brubaker*.

Here's a great page for DD trades: http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-tradepaperbacks-and-graphic-novels.shtml

3: Ann Nocenti’s run, there are two Epic Collections of it so far and it has wonderful art by the team of John Romita Jr. & Al Williamson, that art team also worked with Frank Miller on Man Without Fear and that’s an excellent read too.

3: If you want something with a similar look and tone to the Netflix show, read the **Bendis/Maleev run**.

If you want to read the comics that the show got the majority of its plot points from, read **Frank Miller's run**. The first season draws heavily from his miniseries **The Man Without Fear**, season two pulls from a couple of arcs in his original 80s work, and the third season is loosely based on his **Born Again** storyline.

Personally I'd read **Miller's Daredevil: The Man Without Fear** first as it's the most new-reader-friendly of the lot, then move on to **Bendis** and go back to Miller's early work later on, as comics from the 80s and earlier can be a little difficult for newer readers to get into.

There has been a whole slew of great Daredevil writers in the last couple of decades (there's also *Ed Brubaker*, Mark Waid, Ann Nocenti and Charles Soule to check out), but I would begin with those two.

Stan Lee Issues: 001-009, 011-050, 053

Denny O'Neil Issues: 018, 194-202, 204-207, 210-218, 220-223, 225-226

**Brian Michael Bendis** Issues: 016-019, 026-050, 056-081

*Ed Brubaker* Issues: 082-119, 500

Andy Diggle Issues: 501-512

Mark Waid Issues: Vol.1 001-010, 10.1, 011-036 Vol.2 0.1, 001, 1.50, 002-015, 15.1, 016-018

Charles Soule Issues: 001-028, 595-612

Chip Zdarsky Issues: 001-011 (613-623)

23: Hard not to automatically put **Miller's run** at the top of the list, though I'm a huge fan of both *Brubaker's* and Waid's runs as well.

15: I don’t know about “best,” but Nocenti’s is really... special—there’s really nothing else like it, especially when the Romita/Williamson team is drawing.

**Miller** and Waid are both excellent, and very different from each other.

14: It’s quite congested near the top - **Miller**, Nocenti, **Bendis**, *Brubaker*, Waid (and I imagine Zdarsky’s name will be mentioned amongst them if he keeps up the current standard)

Bottom is between Diggle and Soule for me - I don’t remember Diggle being bad, just nowhere near as good as what came before. It’s been a while though. Some of Soule’s run was good and some of it was really bad, especially when it wasn’t Garney pencilling

7: **Miller** Nocenti Waid *Brubaker* **Bendis**

Denny got fucked by being stuck between **Miller’s runs**. But he cranked out a few solid ones with Mazzucchelli

Zdarsky is only 11 issues in but they’ve been pretty great.

7: **Bendis** is the top of my list, with Kevin Smith's a close second.

5: Nocenti's is the most underrated for me and is the only place where DD fighs Ultron and an evil demonic vacuum cleaner.

Miller has to be number 1 but the next 3 is a toss up between Nocenti, **Bendis** and Waid. I love the opening of Brubaker's but his treatment of Milla Donovan and Melvin Potts (in the same story iirc) really put me off. They just get messed up and it's never been satisfyingly resolved.

5: **Miller**-putting both runs together seals this as Born Again is the best Daredevil.

**Bendis**-great run, some of his best work

Waid-light, airy Daredevil worked

Nocenti-sometimes it felt like Gaiman and it was unique

Zdarsky-could push higher if it keeps up

Soule-this is going to age well

Kelley-I wish it was longer

Chichester-convoluted but cool

Kessel-last run where the DD stood out

5: I think Soule's is my favorite, I just love that run.

3: Really glad there’s a lot of love for Nocenti’s run, I still think it’s really underrated.

5: **Miller** wrote two of the best individual story arcs**- Born Again** and **The Man Without Fear**. However, as a whole, **Bendis’s run** is my favorite.

2: I'd put the Waid run near the top. It was nice to have a Daredevil that was fun and swashbuckling opposed to the usual dower tone. The runs between Miller and Kevin Smith are probably the worst.

> 3: Nocenti had a solid run, I liked it but didnt love it

3: So, no love for Joe Kelly's run?

3: Im'ma stick my head in and say that Kesels run is underappreciated!

But for me, **Miller** is the best.

3: Other than the usual choices like **Miller**, **Bendis**, *Brubaker* etc I always loved the David Mack issues

3: Hard to compare such different writers but

1. **Bendis**
2. **Miller**
3. Nocenti
4. Waid

What is it about DD that brings in such good writers?

2 (OP): I have read everything from Smith to Zdarsky, and from the early years Lee, Thomas, Miller and Nocenti. For me Waid's is my favorite, it was just so very different and fun. I loved his use of lesser known villains. **Bendis** would be a close second.

The bottom though is Soule, I just found it so dry and boring. It had it's moments but those were just so few and far between.

---

 **What is the best Daredevil story arc?**

11: Most people here are going to say “**Born Again**”. **Miller’s entire run** counts as “best Daredevil” imo.

**Bendis’** run is probably a close second. I’ll wager Kevin Smith’s run is 3rd.

> 11: I'd pick Waid, *Brubaker*, Nocenti and Soule over Smith, quite easily.

> 3: **Born Again** is the best super-hero comic ever, but you have to read previous stories that build up to that one.

3: What is kind of awesome about DD is that he is accessible and easy to get into. Read **Man Without Fear**, **Miller’s first run**, Daredevil Love and War, **Born Again**, Smith’s Guardian Devil, **Bendis’ run**, Brubaker‘ coda, Waid, and Soule’s run and you have a great run of amazing books.

You can also read Loeb/Sale’s Yellow, Nocenti/JRJR’s, Chichester/McDaniel’s run for other runs that people love.

Best run is **Born Again**.

Best issue is Vol 1 91

My least Favorite story is Shadowlands.

3: Guardian Devil is probably my favorite. The reveal of Mysterio was amazing, Joe Q's art was on point, and also just because of how important an arc it was for saving Marvel out of bankruptcy.

With that said, that whole entire 119 issue volume is phenomenal start to end - Smith/Mack/**Bendis**/and *Brubaker*. Even Bob Gale's arc was decent up until the end...it makes me wonder if editorial tanked the ending of that story when they decided to go with Bendis over him for ongoing (obviously history shows it was the right decision, just saying).

2: Single story arc? I’d, unsurprisingly, say **Born Again**.

Best run? I’d say **Bendis**’.

2: **Born Again**

2: Parts of a Hole by David Mack and Joe Quesada.

2: Decalogue, Daredevil (1998) #71-#75

1: Don't remember the name of the arc but I love the trial of the White Tiger in Bendis' run.

In terms of a single issue, "Costa de Morte" by *Brubaker* always gives me the feels. It's melancholic as hell and feels positively literary in the best ways.

Currently, the entire Mayor Kingpin arc in Soule's run was fantastic.

### The Flash

12: Wally West recommendations:

The Flash: Born to Run by Mark Waid

The Flash: The Return of Barry Allen by Mark Waid

The Flash: Terminal Velocity by Mark Waid

The Flash: Dead Heat by Mark Waid

The Flash: Race Against Time by Mark Waid

The Flash: Emergency Stop by Grant Morrison

The Flash: The Human Race by Grant Morrison

10: New 52 Barry Allen recommendations:

The Flash: Move Forward by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Rogues Revolution by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Gorilla Warfare by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Reverse by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: History Lessons by Brian Buccellato

>3: The first three of these are really good imo

10: Pre-Flashpoint Barry Allen recommendations:

The Flash: Rebirth by Geoff Johns

The Flash: *The Dastardly Death of the Rogues by Geoff Johns*

The Flash: *The Road to Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

*Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

4: If you want to read about Barry Allen specifically, then The Flash vol. 1: Move Forward is a pretty good place to start, and very new-reader-friendly. (The current "Flash" series that begins with *The Flash vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice* is also very popular, but I haven't read it so I can't comment.)

If you're up for reading about any Flash then I recommend checking out *Mark Waid's run* from the 1990s, which stars Wally West. This is currently being reprinted in paperback form as The Flash by Mark Waid — there are three volumes out so far. The first volume contains a flashback origin story, "Born to Run", so it's a really good introductory point too. (Be warned, though, that the annuals and the "Flash Special" contained in that volume are nowhere near as good as Mark Waid's run ends up becoming, so don't be put off.)

---

17: Best:

*Mark Waid's run* (The Flash vol 2 #62-129,#142-163 plus some other crossover issues and one shots, will be collected in trades soon as The Flash by Mark Waid Books One to ___). By far the best Wally West run and the best Flash run in general, most modern ideas about the character come from his run. Everything from speedforce to the Flash family was from Waid. It's the best example of a legacy character in comics and has the best character growth I've ever read and it's the reason so many people loved the DCU Rebirth one shot.

Almost the Best:

Geoff Johns' first run (The Flash vol 2 #164-225 plus some crossover issues and one shots. Currently being reprinted as The Flash by Geoff Johns with the third trade coming out in a few months). Following on directly from Waid, this was Geoff Johns' third comics which makes it quite impressive. While he may not have had the grand ideas and perfect voice for Wally that Waid had he did one thing better: the villains. Throughout the run Johns gives the best writing for the Rogues that you will see as well as other villains like Grodd and even a new one, Zoom. It all culminates in Rogue War which was a great finale to the run and a great ending to the greatest (IMO) era of the Flash (1990-2005).

Grant Morrison's and Mark Millar's run (The Flash vol 2 #130-141 and some crossover issues. All collected in one trade a few months ago as The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar). Set during Mark Waid's littel break this run features short, bizarre, silver age style stories with some of the most badass and overpowered feats ever in Flash history (like Wally winning a race against instant transportation). There's also a really nice single issue that will make you love Jay Garrick.

Infantino/Broome's (and Fox's) run (The Flash vol 1 #105-174, also lets throw showcase #4, #8, #13, and #14 in there. Being collected in trade as The Flash: The Silver Age with one volume already out as well as omnibus with the second out later in the year). This might be a bit much for you if you can't handle silver age comics. This is the original Barry Allen stuff that brought about the silver age. It features lots of really wacky, bizarre and outrageous sci-fi/superhero stories. Also Infantino is the definitive Flash artist.

Others worth reading:

William Mesner-Loeb's run (The Flash vol 2 #15-61, though it takes a bit to get up to standard. No reprints). Criminally underrated even by me since very few people bring it up. It's a very good look at a young adult Wally who is still immature and learning how to be a proper adult hero. It has a really great supporting cast and also introduces Linda Park, who Mark Waid later builds upon to write the best relationship on comics.

The Flash: Dastardly Death of the Rogues (and while not collected in the trade, I'll throw in The Flash vol 3 #8). This is part of Johns' second run, this time featuring Barry (Rebirth 09, Blackest Night: Flash, Flash vol 3, Flashpoint) and is the only story where Johns got things properly right (the rest suffers from what felt like an editorial agenda to push Barry and screw over the other characters, plus the other stories have some general writing issues). This also happens to be my favourite Barry story due to the excellent writing and the gorgeous art by Manapul and Buccellato (easily my favourite Flash art). All you really need to know is that it's Barry finally settling in and getting back to business after coming back to life (he was dead from 1985-2008, he saved the universe/multiverse).

New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Thankfully DC's recent Rebirth relaunch is bringing things back with DCU Rebirth #1, *The Flash Rebirth* #1 (2016) + The Flash (2016) ongoing series, and Titans Rebirth #1 + Titans ongoing series.

5: Summarize:

The Flash (2011) #0-25 [Origin and a good introduction to The Flash's villains]

*The Flash: Rebirth* (2016) [Re-introduces the history of The Flash which was forgotten]

Then you have two options:

Option 1: The Flash (2016) #1-Present [Upcoming arc is an expanded origin story]

Option 2: The Flash (1987) #62-118 [*Mark Waid's classic run*, which features Wally West as The Flash instead of Barry Allen]

If you want to know why Wally West became The Flash, read Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986), but this is very new-reader unfriendly and requires extensive knowledge of DC Comics history.

4: Starting from the beginning is a long journey, the *Mark Waid series* are good but it’s Wally west. Rebirth is a good Barry Allen jump on point. They’re about to do flash year 1 to give a back story of the new 52/review the flash.

5: Barry Allen started his carrier in the comics in 1956 until 1985 and then he was absent on until 2009. His modern-age series called [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) when he returned. After that 2 trades came (In comics, a trade paperback (often shortened to trade) is a collection of stories originally published in comic books, reprinted in book format, usually capturing one story arc from a single title or a series of stories with a connected story arc or common theme.) called [*The Flash Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Dastardly-Rogues-Brightest/dp/1401231950/) and [*The Flash Vol. 2: The Road to Flashpoint*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Flashpoint-Comics-Unnumbered/dp/1401234488).

After these, a HUGE event came that changed everything called [Flashpont](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384) that "reset" the continuity and started the New 52 age and it's first story-line called [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or alternatively [The Flash: Starting Line (DC Essential Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Starting-Line-DC-Essential/dp/1401284760)) This series (New52) lasted till Spring 2016 and collected 9 trades (the show you watched is based on this era). In early 2016 [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) came (only name change, everything is continued from New52) but a huge exception: a long missing character came back to the grand scene who was missing for so long. Rebirth's first trade is [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X)

So if you are interested in Barry (overall) start with [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) and move onward to [*Flashpont*](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384), but you can just start with [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) and [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X), then read everything up to today. (currently there is a Flash event called Flash War coming out)

But if you are interested in old material, the best place to start is [The Flash: The Silver Age Vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Silver-Age-Vol/dp/1401261108), the first comics where Barry showed up.

(there is an omnibus on sale at the moment (a collection of multiple trades) called [The Flash By Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato Omnibus](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Francis-Manapul-Buccellato-Omnibus/dp/1401261035/) that collects the first 4 trades of the New 52 era.

> If you like TV show, then the current rebirth run might work for you then.
>
> The current rebirth run might work for you then

2: *Flash by Mark Waid* volumes 1-5 Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar Flash by Geoff Johns volumes 1-5

Baron and Messner-Loebs runs are solid as well and do a lot of character development Flash volume 2 issues 1-63

Secret Origins Annual 2 is an awesome Flash story

2: *Flash by Mark Waid vol 1* Flash by Geoff Johns vol 1 Flash by Manapul and Buccellato Flash Rebirth

---

15: The best Flash run is *Mark Waid's run*. Waid built up the Flash Family and introduced the Speedforce into the DC Universe.

That run easily has some of the best Flash stories ever. The only catch is that it's Wally West Flash. Barry Allen sacrificed his life during an event called Crisis on Infinite Earths and Wally took up the mantle.

If you like Barry in the show you'll like Wally in the comics. Wally from the comics is much more similar to Grant Gustin's Flash than the actual Barry from the comics.

[r/theflash](https://www.reddit.com/r/theflash/) has a reading recommendations list for both Barry and Wally. Here's the order I'd recommend for both Barry and Wally

**Reading order for Wally**:
*The Flash by Mark Waid*:
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)

> it's actually released.

*Waid takes a break here*
**The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar (One trade only)**
*Waid comes back here*
**The Flash by Mark Waid**
Book 6(Not released yet)
**The Flash by Geoff Johns**
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)
*Barry Comes Back*
Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*

**Reading Order for Barry**
*The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*
*Flashpoint*
New52 Flash
DC Rebirth #1
*Flash: Rebirth* (2016)

5: *Mark Waid's Flash* (1992-2000) is the best Flash I have ever read, though, granted, I haven't read much else besides his run. I especially like his later stuff, like the "Dark Flash Saga."

> IIRC Dark Flash Saga was never collected in a trade and can only be read through the individual issues (#152-#159). It'll probably be hard to find physical copies but I'm sure if you look hard enough you'd find them somewhere. They are also available in digital copies on Comixology and other digital sites.

3: The Flash | #0, 62-129, 142-159, 162, 231-236; annual 4-6, 8; etc. | 1992-2008 | *Waid*

The Flash | #130-138 | 1997-1998 | Morrison, Millar

The Flash | #164-225, Rogues' Revenge #1-3, Rebirth #1-6, #1-12, etc. | 2000-2011 | Johns

*Flashpoint* | #1-5 | 2011 | Johns

The Flash | #1-29 | 2011-2014 | Manapul, Buccellato

*The Flash (Rebirth)* | #1-ongoing | 2016-2017 | Williamson

1: Everyone will rightfully tell you about *Waid’s* run being the best but if you can find the single issues, it’s worth it to check out Mike Baron and William Messner-Loebs runs since you see the full extent of Wally’s character development.

### Green Lantern

**Where to start with Green Lantern?**

I've heard A LOT about Geoff John's run, so I'm thinking that's where I'll start but I was wondering if there was anything else anyone could recommend.

Edit: What's the consensus on the Rebirth GL stuff?

4: Most people would tell you to start with *Green Lantern: Rebirth*, but I think that story is a bit confusing for a new reader. So here is a list of the events that take place before that story in chronological order.

*Green Lantern: Secret Origin*

Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight/New Dawn

Zero Hour: Crisis in Time

The Final Night

Day of Judgment

*Green Lantern: Rebirth*

2: Geoff Johns’ run is pretty good so far as I’ve read. Apparently he did a book called “In Brightest Day” (not to be confused with the event Brightest Day by him) where it’s just a compilation of green Lantern stories Geoff selected and probably influenced his run in the long haul, so that probably wouldn’t be a bad place to start, but I’d look into it a bit more to be sure.

I also heard you should start with his Origins GL story (in terms of Johns’ own run) even though it takes place about 20 issues into his run because it is Hal’s origin story.

---

**How should I go about reading Blackest Night?** (23 Feb 2014)

There are so many books, but I can't tell which are important. Should I start with straight up Blackest Night, then the red latern one, and so on?

2: I just dived in. I did miss out on the Sinestro Corps war and the beginnings of the war between the Lantern Corps, which is key to the plot of Blackest Night.

What is confusing is the seven current collected comics. They are NOT in order, they are to be read simultaneously. I first read Blackest Night: Green Lantern and didn't get the story's resolution, and the story was confusing as hell to me. When I read Blackest Night it had the conclusion, and the plot points that were confusing in BN:GL were actually omitted and were placed in BN instead.

But I've heard there's a complete Omnibus in the works and I hope it resolves the disjointed issue I had with BN and BN:GL. If you want to go into it, follow DonTravoltino's list, just be warned that the current release (unless you buy every individual comic) is disjointed.

1 (u/DonTravoltino): How I got there.

*Rebirth*, No Fear, Revenge of the Green Lanterns, Hal Jordan Wanted, Sinestro Corps War, *Secret Origin*, Rage of the Red Lanterns, Agent Orange, Blackest Night, Brightest Day.

> 1: After Agent Orange, there is Also Sins of the Star Sapphire and Emerald Eclipse.

1: Blackest Night and Green Lantern: Blackest Night were the two main stories from the event and only ones you need to read to understand the event. Green Lantern Corps: Blackest Night while not essential did add a little more background knowledge to things going on. All the other Blackest Night books are collections of tie ins that show other heroes dealing with people they knew returning from the dead; which there were some good stories in there, but none were essential to understand what was going on.

1: Blackest Night, Green Lantern: Blackest Nigh, and Green Lantern Corps: Blackest Night are the three books I would say you need in order to follow the main story. Everything else is just a tie in and, while it's a good read, unnecessary for the main story.

http://collectededitions.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/blackest-night-trade-reading-order.html?m=1

By following the reading order I posted, ignoring everything but the three books I already mentioned, you should be able to follow the main story without any problems. That's how I did it.

Buy those three books and just bookmark them when an issue ends, move on to the next one on the list and then return to it again when you need to.

**New to DC, Im wanting to read the Blackest night arc, from 09-10, what are the comics i need to get in order to have the best experience?** (Mar 03 2015)

Might be a bit of a simple question but ive been looking and am unsure which trades and individual comics to buy

6: I'm going to say this is one of the worst places for a new comic reader to start. Yes, the story is pretty baller, but between the Green Lantern mythos and individual stories about now dead heroes the amount of information you'd have to need is a tiny bit insane.

> 3: I think <u>you can be okay without knowing exactly who is or isn't dead at the time</u> if you can just say "okay, they were dead when this was written." Plus, a few of the dead heroes they sort of give a backstory on. But I do agree with you, definitely needs to be read after some other GL stuff in order to understand it all.

> 3: Funny enough, this is the arc that got me back into comics. Also the arc that made me never care to go back to Marvel ever again. The characters and plots I had been unfamiliar with for years made me want to dig deeper, want to learn more. So I started catching up with my favorites: The Flash and Aquaman.

> 2: I think Blackest Night was actually one of the first comics I read, and I really liked it. I didn't "get" all of it, but it piqued my interest.

> Me: I do like the next comment.

2: Hre's an extensive list of all the Green Lantern material that leads to Blackest night and where to go after, note that this is only Green Lantern material and there are other heroes you'd want to read up on as well.

- Green Lantern: Rebirth
- Green Lantern: No Fear
- Green Lantern Corps: Recharge
- Green Lantern: Revenge of the Green Lanterns
- Green Lantern Corps: To be a Lantern
- The Rann-Thanagar War
- Infinite Crisis
- Ion: The Torchbearer
- Ion: The Dying Flame
- Green Lantern: Wanted – Hal Jordan
- Green Lantern Corps: The Dark Side of Green
- Green Lantern The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 1
- Green Lantern The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 2
- Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 3 – Tales of the Sinestro Corps
- Green Lantern Corps: Ring Quest
- Green Lantern: Secret Origins
- Green Lantern: Rage of the Red Lanterns

- Green Lantern: Revenge of the Black Hand
- Green Lantern Corps: Alpha War
- Green Lantern New Guardians: Beyond Hope
- Red Lanterns: Death of Red Lanterns
- Green Lantern: Rise of the Third Army
- Green Lantern: The End

If you're on a budget this will help:

- GL: Rebirth
- GLC: Recharge
- Green Lantern The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 1
- Green Lantern The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 2
- Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 3 – Tales of the Sinestro Corps
- Green Lantern: Secret Origins
- Blackest Night
- Blackest Night: Green Lantern
- Blackest Night: Green Lantern Corps
- Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps
- Blackest Night: Black Lantern Corps Vol. 1
- Blackest Night: Black Lantern Corps Vol. 2
- Blackest Night: Rise of the Black Lantern
- War of the Green Lanterns as an intro to new 52 state of Lanterns.

Then go with the New 52 Green / Red lanterns. Johns has stated that he envisioned Hal Jordan's overarching story arc as a trilogy, with Rebirth, Sinestro Corps War and Blackest Night acting as the three chronological acts.

1: I agree, I'm unsure of your expose level to GL beforehand but even if you know the general idea around it there is at least 4-5 volumes I'd recommend before even touching Blackest Night. I'd recommend: Secret Origins, Sinestro Corps Wars, Rage of the Red Lanterns and Agent Orange to touch the minimal level of pre-Blackest Night stuff.

> 1: Might want to add GL Rebirth to that list.
>
> > 1: I would also like to add Mystery of the Star Sapphire and Sins of the Star Sapphire. Can't remember if they were absolutely necessary, but it sure would help to read those as well.
> >
> > > 1: Feel life those are less necessary than the other books mentioned. Would lump emerald eclipse in the same boat. I read them, for completeness, but if you have limited funds they are the most skippable.

1: When I first started reading and was trying to get into Green Lantern I wanted to do the same thing, get right into Blackest Night. But I took the advice of others who commented here and definitely will make a lot more sense if you read a lot of the beforehand stuff. Plus Sinestro Corps war is an amazing story.

1: I'd treat Blackest Night as part 3 of a trilogy. Rebirth > Sinestro Corps War > Blackest Night. I read them in that order and loved it. Corps War was my favorite.

### Hellboy

25: Hellboy isn't like most superhero comics where there's multiple "runs" to keep track of. Nearly all of it is written by Mike Mignola and nearly all of it is worth reading. Just start at the beginning with [Hellboy, Volume 1: *Seed of Destruction*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593070942) and follow the rest in [suggested reading order](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2017/).

> Updated version of the reading order: [link](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2019/).

9: Mignola writes all of Hellboy and co-writes most of the tie-ins if not all, the universe is pretty amazing just in itself, can't go wrong with Mignola.

7: There is only one Hellboy run, and that's the Mike Mignola one that begins with *Seed of Destruction*. It is available in regular trades that collect roughly four to six issues each, or the oversized Library Edition hardcovers which collect twice that much. This is also due to be released Omnibus form starting this year.

There's one main BPRD run split into three cycles, *Plague of Frogs*, Hell on Earth and The Devil You Know. I would recommend starting *Plague of Frogs* once you've reached at least volume 4 of Hellboy, Conqueror Worm (this is fifth), which is what Plague of Frogs follows directly on from. There are some lovely paperback and hardcover collections of PoF available for reasonable prices, and HoE is also due to have some released soon. TDYK has only just started so is currently only available in single issues, but give it time.

There are also the prequel miniseries Hellboy & The BPRD, and BPRD 1946, 1947 and 1948. These are prequels and as such don't have to be read at any particular point, but I'd at least recommend reading BPRD 1947 before starting BPRD: Hell On Earth as a character is introduced in 1947 who comes back and has a large part to play in HoE.

There is also the Abe Sapien solo series, which happens mostly alongside BPRD: Hell on Earth. Abe runs away from the BPRD during this period, so if you want to know what he's up to, read the Abe Sapien solo series. Otherwise it is not necessary to the main BPRD plot.

> 5: I would add a few things to this.
>
> The sapien series will likely be more important to the overall plot in the next cycle of bprd. And Hellboy and the BPRD is a full ongoing series but likely not important to the future and mignola wrote or was heavily involved in at least half of it as of now so it's still one run basically.

---

16: The spin-offs are just as good. I recommend *Frankenstein Underground*, I'm a sucker for the Frankenstein myth and the series does not disappoint.

12: Comic Hellboy is just a lot more fun than the movie version. The del Toro movies are totally fine, but Hellboy always sort of annoyed me in them. He's sort of a whiney teen in them. I much prefer him as a grouchy old man.

I think BPRD is one of the best long form comics we have as well. They do a great job of creating a lot of finality. When people fuck up, there are lasting consequences. You get to also see this crew develop from being a regular team to these hardened war vets.

9: They absolutely are; those and especially BPRD are among the best that comics have to offer

8: Abe has his own set of comics as well. I think his are set while Hellboy is in hell.

---

**Essential/Best Hellboy Comics?**

5: I may missing some, but here is what I think

- Seed of Destruction (Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- Wake the Devil (Hellboy – Volume 2: Wake the Devil, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- The Nature of the Beast (Hellboy – Volume 4: The Right Hand of Doom, Omnibus: Hellboy: The Complete Short Stories – Volume 1)
- The Corpse (Hellboy – Volume 3: The Chained Coffin and Others, Omnibus: Hellboy: The Complete Short Stories – Volume 1)
- Almost Colossus (Hellboy – Volume 3: The Chained Coffin and Others, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</u>)
- *Conqueror Worm* - here is where he leaves the BPRD (Hellboy – Volume 5: Conqueror Worm, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 2: Strange Places</u>)
- Darkness Calls (Hellboy – Volume 8: Darkness Calls, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- The Wild Hunt (Hellboy – Volume 9: The Wild Hunt, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- Storm & Fury (Hellboy – Volume 12: The Storm and the Fury, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>, Hellboy – Volume 12: The Storm and the Fury, <u>Omnibus: Hellboy – Volume 3: The Wild Hunt</u>)
- Hellboy in Hell - end of series (everything in <u>Hellboy Omnibus – Volume 4: Hellboy in Hell</u>)

There's much more, but I would consider those to be the most essential for understanding the whole story without being too confused.

> Conqueror worm is my favourite of the comics and is really a defining point in hellboy’s character.

---

5: Main Hellboy: The Troll Witch, *Conquerer Worm*, The Third Wish, The Crooked Man, The Wild Hunt

Spin-offs: BPRD - The Long Death

3: Anything written and drawn by Mignola is great. Anything by him and Fegredo or Corben is also great.

The BPRD stuff is mostly good and the minis of the side characters tend to vary in quality.

> +People say that *Lobster Johnson* is also good series.

### Hulk

**I want to get into the hulk. Where should I start?**

7: Along with the modern essentials like **Planet Hulk** and **World War Hulk**, I've heard good things about Peter David's run on the Hulk.

> 4: As well you should have. David's run really explored the duality and personality struggles between Banner and Hulk. More people need to read this. **Planet Hulk** and **WWH** felt like all Hulk all the time to me. And I felt lost a bit of the characters core.

4: Modern Essentials

- [**Incredible Hulk Visionaries**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0785115412) | [#331-457](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/9142/incredible_hulk_1962_331) | 1987-1998 | David
- [Return of the Monster](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0785153462) | [Incredible Hulk #34-39](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/14434/incredible_hulk_1999_34), [Startling Stories: Banner #1-4](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/18798/startling_stories_banner_2001_1) | 2001-2002 | Jones, Azzarello
- [Hulk: Gray](https://www.amazon.com/Hulk-Gray-Jeph-Loeb/dp/0785113460) | [#1-6](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/365/hulk_gray_2003_1) | 2003-2004 | Loeb
- [Tempest Fugit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0785115439) | [Incredible Hulk #77-82](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1555/incredible_hulk_1999_77) | 2005 | David
- [**Planet Hulk**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0785120122) | [Incredible Hulk #92-105](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/3530/incredible_hulk_1999_92) | 2006-2007 | Greg Pack

3: I'd say go back and start with **Peter David's run on Incredible Hulk**, is the absolute best run of books with Hulk and you wouldn't get Planet Hulk and World War Hulk without it.

---

**Where to start reading Hulk?**

3: I'm a big Hulk fan, and my favorite comic of all time is actually a Hulk story (And the first one I owned). I think Hulk is one of the few characters where you can just pick a story and start reading. He doesn't have a lot of crucial backstory so long as you know the whole "Banner got gamma'd now he's sometimes big and green" stuff. The way Hulk and Banner interact are almost always up to the writer, so whatever story you jump in will let you know how they'll be interacting for that particular story.

For stories I'd say read/watch **Planet Hulk**. It's a bit long, but I loved every page of it. General plot: Hulk forced into gladiatorial combat on an alien world.

After that the follow up comic is **World War Hulk**, which was a huge event but the main story stands perfectly well on it's own. General plot: Hulk's back. He's pissed.

If you want a continuing story that's fairly recent, Indestructible Hulk is your man. General plot: He works for shield as a scientist/weapon. Banner builds, Hulk destroys.

Like I said, you can just sort of jump headfirst into any Hulk stories you want. If you ever see a picture of Hulk and you think, "Man, I want to read that. I wonder what it's from." Just find out the source of it and start reading! Hope you enjoy em, man!

2: Indestructible Hulk (2012) is, I would say, the best most recent jumping on point. If you've read that and Hulk (2014), then the next most recent point would be the **Planet Hulk** + **World War Hulk** arc that leads into Hulk (2008) and Incredible Hulks (2009).

2: For me personally I loved hulk for years, when they killed betty banner, I was done. I tried **planet hulk** but I couldn't get into it.

Grey Hulk, Mr.Fixit was probably my favorite time.

Future Imperfect story of the future was great, but that's like 2 comics.

Hulk is actually a really hard character to write IMO.

> 2: Did you ever check out Betty as Red She-Hulk? I really enjoyed her character development.
>
> > 1: No I didn't I would read a few issues if you can recommend. Thanks.
> >
> > > 2: I would just jump in with Jeff Parker's Red She-Hulk series. The story that led up to it was kind of dumb, but Parker takes the premise and does fun stuff with it.

---

**Best Hulk Comics?**

11: **Peter David’s run**, hands down.

*Al Ewing’s IMMORTAL HULK*, which is ongoing now, is also good.

> 3: Agreed. PAD's 12-year run was amazing.
>
> > 2 (OP): What is it about **David’s run** that makes the Hulk better? Eg. In **Planet Hulk, Pak** does a great job of developing the character and the team into very relatable and likeable people and really shows the whole thing as an epic adventure 
> >
> > > 3: There's adventure during PAD's run, especially when he's affiliated with the Pantheon. But, there's also a lot of character development, especially in the relationship between Bruce and Betty. And his Rick Jones, as the man who's seen it all, is hilarious. The book under his writing can alternate between incredibly dark and rip-roaringly funny, but never jarringly so.
> > >
> > > And he works with some of the top artists, including Todd McFarlane, Dale Keown, and Gary Frank. So it's not just fun to read, but gorgeous to look at as well, for the most part.

4: Check out Incredible Hulk Epic Collection: The Hulk Must Die, the first eight issues (Tales to Astonish #60 - 67) are drawn by Steve Ditko and he did a great job with the character, it's a shame it's so overlooked because Ditko is synonymous with Spider-Man and Doc Strange (and rightfully so, of course) but his Hulk work is great and good, classic Silver Age fun.

> 1 (OP): Do I need knowledge of the Hulk before reading this? I’ve never read the epic collections because they don’t seem to collect the comics the best way, or I feel there may be things left out. I’ve only ever read Planet Hulk and WW Hulk, so I really know nothing about the character except he’s Bruce banner and extreme emotions turn him into a big green monster.
>
> > 2: It's pretty early on in the character's publication history so you don't need to know too much, and also the Epic Collections are perhaps the best way to collect comics, they are very comprehensive and cover a lot of material that has yet to be reprinted, it's one of the best reprint programs right now.

5: **Peter David's run** in the 80s and 90s.

2: The current series is only about four issues deep and it's great.

I really liked Jeph Loeb's run which introduced the Red Hulk.

Pick up Punisher: Confederacy of Dunces. I don't wanna spoil why, but you'll see. It also has Spider-Man, Wolverine and Daredevil in it.

2: I’ve always liked Bruce Jones’ run the most.

**Best Hulk runs?**

I’ve been reading *Immortal Hulk* on Marvel Unlimited and it has really piqued my interest in the big green guy. I’d really only seen him in movies and animation before so I was surprised to see that he has a larger vocabulary than what I’m used to.

I’ve heard **Peter David’s run** is the gold standard. Is it okay to jump right in there? Should I read some of Mantlo’s run that came before? Is there any more modern stuff that’s notable besides Planet Hulk and Immortal?

15: Read Mantlo’s run for the sake of completion if you want to, as a Hulk Fan I’m sure you will Like it.

**David’s Run** is definitive Hulk, and yeah you can jump right in, it will probably be eye opening for you, a lot of the big moments in Hulk’s life happened during this run.

Pak’s Run is pretty good, **Planet Hulk** being the best part of it.

> 6: **Planet Hulk** is very good, but I feel like the later parts of Pak's run are really underrated.
>
> > 3: Especially when it was rebranded as Incredible Hercules. Great run.

8: **Planet Hulk**>**World War Hulk** is fantastic. **Peter David's run** has ups and downs but went to places the series had never been before. You may enjoy the first half-dozen issues (by Lee, Kirby and Ditko) from the early '60s--they're very much of their time, but Immortal Hulk has been drawing on them extensively.

6: Have to recommend Bruce Jones run. The Norton Hulk movie pulled from this material. Even though it petered out towards the end, the first 2/3 or so was a much needed jolt at the time for a character that had been stuck in mediocrity for years

> -1: Eh.
>
> That run is pretty forgettable. It had its fans at the time, and publications like Wizard gushed about it, but it was really boring, in hindsight. Nothing much happened. It was more mood and mystery than anything else. Which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but for Hulk it felt like a long denouenent. And the ending was bad. Which for a run that built itself up so much on the final reveals, needed to stick the landing.
>
> Yeah, you could say the movie pulled from the run. But the run was being nostalgic fan service to the 1970s tv show. Which also was boring. The show was restricted to a moody drama because there was no way to afford a super villain battle each week.
>
> And mediocre for years? Yeah, Joe Casey's run was pointless and so was John Byrne's return. But David's last few years of his run, while meandering because of Heroes Reborn, was still very good. And Paul Jenkins's run was good as well.
>
> But, Hulk was not selling well, which Jones run was able to fix at the time. But reading it now, I think it is completely skippable, and not just for the reason that a lot was retconned away.
>
> >  4: Still think it's noteworthy despite its flaws. I was trying to recommend something that wasn't already brought up, and considering Hulk's publishing history, I'm comfortable putting that in a hypothetical top 10 on the merits you mentioned alone

4: **Greg Pak's Hulk** is my favorite comic ever. Can't recommend it enough.

4: **Peter David** is the definitive run. Early to first half of **Bruce Jones’ run** is good. **Greg Pak’s Planet Hulk** is good. A lot of people will hate on it, but I think Jeph Loeb’s Hulk run was a lot of fun. Al Ewing’s current Hulk run is good.

2: John Byrne's run is good. Especially the Mr. Fixit stuff.

> 3: Mr Fixit is **Peter David’s run**. I thought Byrne was only like 5-6 issues? He did the wedding issue.
>
> > 1: Eep. Don't know what I was thinking, you're right it was Peter David.

2: There’s some really good recommendations in here. Especially the **Greg Pak** and **Peter David stuff**. For a good recap of his origin, check out Hulk: Grey by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale

---

**Best hulk stories to read?**

Preferably your top 3 or 5? I've only read **WW HULK** and I was very young.

6: **Peter David is to Hulk** as Frank Miller is to Daredevil, Alan Moore is to Swamp Thing and Chris Claremont is to the X-Men. Nobody really comes close, I recommend his entire run.

5: I think **world war hulk** is the best, but **planet hulk** arc is the lead into **world war hulk** so it's also a good one. I also like hulk future imperfect because of maestro

5: I really love Duggan’s short Hulk run. The Hulk becomes super smart and attempts to cure other Gamma guys. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0785190686/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1521940772&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=gerry+duggan+hulk&dpPl=1&dpID=51R3HVMKHuL&ref=plSrch

**Peter David’s Hulk run** is the gold standard and holds up well.

3: Al Ewing’s upcoming Hulk series sounds kind of amazing. He’s been posting interesting early Hulk panels at alewing.tumblr.com —his hashtags are pretty wonderful...

3: I think the best hulk story is **planet hulk+world war hulk**. With **planet hulk** diving more to the character of the hulk and **world war** is one of the best "hulk smash" reads.

Aside from that some recommendations:

- Future Imperfect (from the 80's, not secret wars)
- Hulk the end
- 'Indistructible hulk' is a fun series but it ends with a cliffhanger that leads to the doc green run which I found a lot less enjoyable.
- Incredible Hulk by jason aaron from 2012 is great.

2: **Planet Hulk**, Old Man Logan, & Future Imperfect.

I recently picked up some collections with early 80s Mantlo/Buscema Hulk- good stuff & highly recommended- Hulk # 269-313.

Early Kirby/Lee Hulk is weird because Hulk acts more like the Thing than what we know today, but still interesting for the genesis of the character.

A story that recently came out about Maestro I recommend is 'Old Man Logan- Days of Anger.'

2: Ultimate Hulk Vs Wolverine.

Short, Sweet, and oh so brutal.

---

**What are some good hulk comics besides Planet Hulk and World War Hulk?**

20: *The Immortal Hulk* is widely considered the best comic Marvel's putting out right now.

17: **Peter David's run** from the 90s.

> 7: 80s and 90s, actually.
>
> And you can go back to Mantlo's Smart Hulk run as well. TPBs start at issue 269, so that's as good a place to start as any, and Mantlo runs through 313, Byrne from 314-319, Milgrom 320-330, and PAD is 331-467.

8: *Hulk the End* one shot was so good!

> 3: Depressing af though

5: Future Imperfect

Hulk: Gray

### Spider-Man

**What's the absolute best Spider-Man series?**

76: **Ultimate Spider-Man**. You get to see Peter right from when he gets his powers. Start with Ultimate Spider-Man (2000) #1 and read from there. The whole thing's on Marvel Unlimited.

29: I have to go with **Ultimate Spider Man**. It's got everything you want from a Spider Man book: Cool villains, snappy repartees, good characterization of Peter, and MJ. Plus, the quality is very consistent. Even the Ultimatum tie-in wasn't terrible, and that's saying a lot when comparing it with the rest of the event.

20: I mean it can only really be *Amazing*. It's the one that built all the mythos that makes Spidey what he is. It also has the benefit of being told from many different creative teams.

> 17: Yup, Ultimate has a more modern surface so I can see why people might prefer that, but the first 200 issues of *ASM* are really the "bible" of Spider-Man
>
> > 18: And much like the Bible it can be a dry, stolid, boring slog for people who weren't around when it was written or don't spend all their time around people who champion it.
> >
> > See also: most classic literature as it is taught in US English classes.
> >
> > > 14: I don't know. I think it's pretty readable, especially after the first 30-40 issues pass and you get used to the Woody Allen jokes and other 1960s references. The plots are tight and Peter shines.

16: This is kind of a loaded question because of how long *ASM* had been around.

My honest opinion, Marv Wolfman's year and a half run on *Amazing* is one of the best I've ever seen. It started at 184 and ran up to 200. The stories and plots all tied in together with the anniversary 200th issue culminating in Spider-Man's confrontation with the burglar that killer Uncle Ben.

The title came full circle at that point and considered by many as the end of that first era of Spider-Man (Silver Age).

Other notables are Roger Stern, Peter David and David Michelinie's runs.

16: *Spider-Man blue*. Short, limited run, but it's fantastic.

9: **Ultimate Spider-Man** is going to be the most accessible by a wide margin.

*Amazing Spider-Man* from the beginning is the founder, and it *is* good, but its influence may exceed its readability to you.

Everything else is secondary. Seriously, *everything*.

---

**Best Spider-Man comics?**

18: **Ultimate Spider-Man** is superb pretty much from the get-go.

*Kraven's Last Hunt* and *The Death of Gwen Stacey* are the two most popular stories from the "classic" era.

*Spider-Man Blue* by Jeph Loeb is brilliant.

Dan Slott's run on *Amazing Spider-Man* is very hit-and-miss for me but a lot of people like it, I'd give it a look especially if you enjoyed his work on Superior. He starts with "Brand New Day" which you can get in TBPs right now.

EDIT: words

9: 

- The Death of Jean DeWolff
- *Kraven's Last Hunt*
- Stan Lee/Steve Ditko's run (the original run)
- David Michelinie/Todd McFarlane's run (a great run that introduced Venom)
- Pretty much anything Roger Stern wrote
- Return of the Burglar
- Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut
- *Death of Gwen Stacy*
- **Ultimate Spider-Man** (alternate universe)

4: *Kraven's Last Hunt*, *Spider-Man Blue*, Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut

3: No one recommending Spider-Island? I thought it was great.

2: 

- *Death of Gwen Stacy*
- Wolverine and Spider-Man (mini) series
- Back In Black
- Most **Ultimate Spider-Man**

> 3: Wolverine/Spider-Man was so great. There was a really good dynamic between the two of them.
>
> Wolverine and Spider-Man get lost in the timestream, and have to find their way back to their time. It's pretty outlandish but still pretty good.
>
> edit: [Link to the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astonishing_Spider-Man_%26_Wolverine). Full title is Astonishing Spider-Man and Wolverine.

2: *Kraven's Last Hunt*, *Spider-Man Blue*, *Death of the Gwen Stacey*, Nothing can stop the Juggernaut, Birth of Venom, Torment, The Other, Back in Black, Flowers for Rhino.

Brand New Day (3 trades), New Ways to Die, Big Time, Spider-Island, Ends of the Earth

Marvel Knights Spiderman (Mark Millar 12 issue run), Ultimate Spider-Man (all of it has been stellar), Astonishing Spider-Man and Wolverine (mini-series), etc. :)

---

**In your opinion, what is the best Spider-Man's comics?**

I'm not a comic old reader, so I'm searching for the best comics and sagas of my favorite superhero.

I liked so much "*Kraven's Last Hunt*", "The Kid Who Collected Spider-Man", "**Ultimate Spider-Man: Power and Responsibility**", "*The Amazing Spider-Man: Coming Home*" and "*The Death of Gwen Stacy*".

6: Grim hunt and spider-island are very good. Also the entire superior spider-man run is just brilliant.

3: A lot of Marvel's old characters don't hit their strides until the 70s or 80s but *Amazing Spider-Man* is one of those titles that hits its stride immediately and keeps it up for a very long time. I'd honestly recommend just plowing through the first 150 or so issues, the stuff written by Stan Lee and Gerry Conway. I got the Essentials volumes that collect them and love them.

3: Death of Jean Dewolff

If This Be My Destiny

New Ways to Die

Character Assassination

Dying Wish

Death of Spider-Man(Ultimate)

Alien Symbiote "saga"

2: Well, the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko run is legendary. Roger Stern did fantastic with the character in the 80s. In addition to "The Kid Who Collected Spider-Man", he also put Spidey up against an unstoppable force in "Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!" His original Hobgoblin arc is great, too.

"The Death of Jean DeWolff", "One Small Break", are both very good "dark" stories.

As for something more modern and light-hearted, I'd recommend "Snow Day" and "The Rules of the Game". As well as "Spider-Man/Human Torch" and "The Commuter Cometh".

2: The original Spidey 2099 and the current one, it's too easy to pick out good Peter stuff but Miguel is so fuckin awesome.

---

#### Miles Morales

**Need Help Finding Best Miles Morales Origin Comic**

3: His origin starts in All-New Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1.

If you want a collection, the Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man Omnibus collects the whole Ultimate run.

1: Pick up Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man Ultimate Collection 1! Should have all you need!

---

**Where to start reading Miles Morales Spider-Man?**

5: Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man relaunch from 2011.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_%28Miles_Morales%29#Ultimate_Comics:_Spider-Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(Miles_Morales)#Ultimate_Comics:_Spider-Man)

> 2 (OP): Thank you! I googled and found his first appearance but didn't know if that's where I was supposed to start.
>
> > 2: The first appearance was Ultimate Fallout which was a six issue mini after Peter died, but it was more of a compilation book and was only very tangentally about Miles. The Ult Spidey book itself is all you really need. Although saying this, the supporting cast (MJ, Gwen, May, Jessica etc) might be a bit confusing if you've not been reading the whole thing but I think it'll be perfectly easy to follow. I gave vol 1 of Miles to a 10 year old and he got it just fine (I think because ten year olds are less hung up on needing to understand everything).

3: If you want to start with Miles:

- Ultimate Comics: Fallout #4
- Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #1-28 (includes issue 16.1)
- Spider-Men 1-5 (you can read this after issue 12 of the Miles run)
- Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man #1-3 (you can skip the other Cataclysm stuff; it's awful)
- Ultimate Spider-Man #200 (the only 10/10 review I've given; perfect love letter to the series/character)
- Miles Morales: The Ultimate Spider-Man #1-12

If you want to start with Peter, here's the reading order: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ultimate_Spider-Man_story_arcs#Collected_editions

Most of Miles and all of Peter is on Marvel Unlimited.

Also [this just came out yesterday for only $1] (http://i.imgur.com/zoXEnne.jpg)

And shameless plug - if you're interested, I started a Miles Morales podcast with some fellow Redditors that had kicked off with this last run. You can read along with us at [http://www.ultimatespinpodcast.com](http://www.ultimatespinpodcast.com/).

**Best miles Morales storyline**

5: His original run "Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man" (second volume) is really strong

3: His first one with prowler imo

2: I really like the run where he was a S.H.I.E.L.D Agent

-2: None of them are very good. He’s just a tool to get even more money, without putting forth any original ideas. Same thing with all of the other spider-verse characters and spin-offs in the last 10 years. Remember, this IS from the same people who went through with OMD.

> 7: Interesting. I've only heard good things about Morales. What don't you like about his books?
>
> > 1: I think it's fair to say that when the character has the mask on and is doing the super hero thing he behaves just like regular Spider-Man, right down to the quips. Additionally he's got extra powers for some reason, the ability to turn invisible and an electric shock. These are often used as pretty glaring examples of deus ex machina. In my opinion that's pretty damn lazy. And it's absolutely true that he's part of the "you like Spider-Man man? How about TWO Spider-Men? Now how about THREE?" attitude that Marvel has had about all of its characters for the last several years.
> >
> > On the plus side his relationships outside of the mask are pretty interesting and different from Peter's and I enjoy his supporting cast tremendously. All of my previous criticisms aside the initial Bendis run is great and I just ended up falling for the character. There is zero reason not to at least check out that run.
> >
> > > 2: This is pretty spot on, but the thing that frustrates me most is how Marvel won’t just create a new superhero. It’s, here’s another Captain America, here’s another Iron Man, here’s another Spider-Man. It would be so much better if they created new, unique characters, or at the very least, gave them different names.
> > >
> > > Also, the morales storylines are just not-as-good remakes of previous Spider-Man stories. I know that new readers don’t always see that, but they are. Quesada’s Marvel is solely focused on increasing profits, and it’s so annoying to fans who remember when comics were just comics.
> > >
> > > > 1: I used to agree with the sentiment about not creating "new" characters but I've come around. I dressed up as Spider-Man as a kid for Halloween. Seeing the mountains of pictures of kids of different races and genders that feel like dressing up like these characters now is really great. I just wish Marvel would do a better job of having characters like Miles be a bit more different than the source material when they're doing the super hero thing.

#### Spider-Gwen

**Is Spider-Gwen any good?**

38: Spider-Gwen is strange, funny, unpredictable (!), and is doing really interesting things with the whole "great power great responsibility" theme, powered by incredible art and intense colors. Currently my favorite.

The current run of Spider-Gwen started including extensive bios for each character with a ton of backstory that hasn't been addressed in the series itself. Basically Jason Latour gives you a few issues' worth of story in each one. Gwen's full origin (including how she got her costume and webshooters) is explained in Radioactive Spider-Gwen #1.

And hey, come read along with us! :-)

http://ultimatespinpodcast.com/

I've even done interviews with the creative team - all very cool people:

http://ultimatespinpodcast.com/category/interviews/

18: Yes. It's got a great twist on characters like Daredevil and Reed Richards and has a certain individual unique quality to it you can't find in a lot of other comics.

14: Admittedly I haven't read the most recent issues so maybe it's gotten better. But I gave up on it after the first run and a few issues into the second run. I love the setting, backstory and alternate characters but it takes too much time for anything to happen and I got annoyed when they started doing more and more crossover stuff that I couldn't follow.

The art is also hit or miss. Sometimes it has a nice "grungy" look, other times it just looks kind of ugly.

12: I was enjoying it until they kept tying it into the regular Marvel universe. I like inter-universe stories but let your new characters live in their world for a bit Marvel. Spider-Person stories need to stay somewhat grounded. And hopping realities every few issues is not very grounded.

10: The costume is really good. Aside from that, no, not really. The art is muddy and the story muddier.

4: I've only read the first trade but I found it decent but unremarkable. Basically the Spidey origin for the x-th time, it didn't feel that different to me just because Gwen is in it. But I had only read Ultimate Spidey half a year before, so maybe it was just too soon for yet another take at the same origin story for me.

3: I'd say it's not as good as it could be.

I like the concept, the world which Jason Latour has created is really interesting and twists concepts in original ways, and I do enjoy the grungy artwork; it fits with how Gwen would view her world.

But the dialogue is often really peculiar, especially in the earlier series (I will readily admit that it has gotten better recently), and it seems to take a long time to get to things, and throws in concepts really quickly only to forget about them, like Gwen's world's version of Green Goblin and Captain America.

I much prefer Silk, and Spider-Woman if we're talking about Spider-Women titles.

3: Its a lot weaker (especially writing wise) than Spiderwoman or Silk, but its generally good.

---

**Is the Spidergwen series any good?**

8: It depends. I'd say its best when it focuses on Gwen and her world (so basically everything not a crossover as those are usually heavily ooc)

That said I'd preface my recommendation in that Spidergwen is a very dreary series. It's comic about a very depressed, down on herself, heavily self questioning hero.

It's a series where the protagonist isn't in any way far from your standard superhero fair, but heavily tinged in nihilism and regret. Like many comics have that arc where the hero questions their role as a hero due to an event. Spider-Gwen's entirety is that arc.

That preface exists cause its a tone that can wear on a reader especially compared to all the much more upbeat comics around it.

8: I read it for about a year and dropped it, the story just got really dull for me.

6: Grab a Marvel Unlimited subscription and you can read all the back issues with that! It's $10/month or $70/year.

6: I like it. The SpiederGwen universe is a nice twist on the Marvel universe, but the twists are interesting and suitable not just a way to desperately reinvent every character in a deterministic fashion.

5: not really at all

3: It's got its ups and downs.

I think the first two volumes worth (Vol. 0 and Vol. 1) are really great. Together they work really well, enough that I'd wholeheartedly recommend the hard cover that collects the both of them. After that it can be hit and miss.

Just going by the collections that come after: Spider-Women is a very mixed cross-over. Got its good parts. Got its good parts. The development for Gwen frustrated me because of how out of nowhere it is, and how much impact it has on the character. Weapon of Choice (Vol. 2) does work with the hand its dealt well enough though. Those issues are fine, if a bit uneven. Almost all of the stuff in Long Distance (Vol. 3), is completely pointless. To be fair, it's just a few issues as well as an annual and a short crossover, but it barely inches the plot forward. Sitting in a Tree feels equally pointless, but some of the banter between Gwen and Miles is fun, and the romance plot isn't near as much of a focus as the name would imply. I've poked into the issues that Predators (Vol. 4) will contain, and they look to be at least decent, and a return to actual plot advancement. I'm pretty excited and hopeful for the Gwenom stuff, because I'd love to see what they do with the symbiote and what that sort of darkness could do to Gwen's head, especially with how much the world seems to keep spitting on her.

Overall I genuinely love the character. It's nice to have someone who exists within her own continuity without having to deal with all of the baggage that comes with residing in Earth-616. Plus the basis for her origin is such an amazing re-imagining of Peter's origin story. Much as I have qualms with the middle of her current run, I do still very much like the character and only hope that she keeps on keeping on, but with *her* plot allowed to focus on *her*.

A few stories that are more lighter in tone would do some good though. It's worth noting just that, like I said, the story seems to be about Gwen just constantly taking metaphorical (and literal) hits, with very few straight forward victories.

2: I don't normally read Spider-Gwen but her arc with Miles was amazing. If that's any indication of her solo series than I'd pick it up

---

**Help with Spider Gwen Comics?**

Trying to get my girlfriend more involved in my love of comics and she has expressed interest in Spider Gwen. Told her I would pick her some stuff up. Should I just start her off with the first TPB? Anything to avoid? Easy to pick up and read without much knowledge on the Marvel universe? More of a DC guy myself so unfortunately I won't have many answers for her if she has a lot of questions.

Thanks guys!

7: It's almost entirely standalone. She's basically relegated to her own universe aside from one or two crossovers, one of which isn't even really related to her!

Volume 0: Most Wanted? is the place to start, featuring her introduction story from the Edge of Spider-verse miniseries, and then her own five-issue mini from before a big reboot.

From there you can just start off collecting the trades for her series!

A full reading order:

- Spider-Gwen 0: Most Wanted?
- Spider-Man: Spiderverse (optional, but does feature more of the character)
- Spider-Gwen 1: Greater Power
- Spider Women (crossover with Silk and Spider-Woman)
- Spider-Gwen 2: Weapon of Choice
- Spider-Gwen 3: Long Distance (crossover with Miles Morales Spider-Man)
- Spider-Gwen 4: Predators
- Spider-Gwen 5: Gwenom

She was also in the Web Warriors series, but that didn't really effect her character much. I haven't read it and don't feel like I'm missing anything.

> 4: Web Warriors does play one major role. It's how she got the dimensional travel device that is used in the Spider-Women, Miles Morales, and Gwenom arcs.

4: 

> Easy to pick up and read without much knowledge on the Marvel universe?

I'm not caught up on it so I can't give specific recommendations, but it's perfectly understandable without outside Marvel knowledge. It's set in an alternate universe outside the main 616 one so you can just pick it up and start reading from the first trade.

3: I think it stands alone without previous knowledge, though as an old fart who read the Death of Gwen Stacy as a kid, one of my greatest pleasures in the comic is seeing its alternate take on the history and how it upends Matt Murdock and Frank Castle's characters. If your GF is passingly familiar with the Marvel Netflix shows, that will help.

---

**Where to start in comics for spider Gwen?**

7: The first few years of comics are in nice paperback collections. Start with [Vol 0](https://www.amazon.com/Spider-Gwen-Vol-Most-Wanted-ebook/dp/B017JHJHJ6/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1545938603&sr=8-7&keywords=spider-gwen+vol) and work your way up. There are other side stories that involve her as a character, and while they're generally still considered cannon, they're not written or drawn by the same team so the tone is quite different. These would be the several Spider-verse runs and the Web Warriors runs, but neither are really required reading.

5: Really depends if you wanna go really hard into it or not. Personally I would start with the collection of the original Spider-verse and volume 1 of Spider-Gwen (if you think you’re gonna dive right in, go for the hard cover one, it collects more issues).

If you’re looking for the most efficient collection of required reading for Spider-Gwen, you’re gonna want Spider-verse, Spider-Gwen volumes 1-3 (the hard cover versions, there are only 3 out atm), the trade paper backs of volume 4 and 5 of Spider-Gwen, and the trade paper back of Spider-Women, the cross over event between Gwen, Spider Woman, and Silk. You don’t need the Miles/Gwen crossover (the name of the cross over event escapes me atm), it’s covered in hard cover volume 3 I believe.

Gwen also has an ongoing title right now titled Ghost-Spider, but it’s only 3 issues in and doesn’t have a trade out yet.

Edit: I haven’t read web warriors, but she hasn’t really referenced her experiences with the warriors so I assume it’s probably skippable. She’s also present in Spider-geddon but just for the 1st issue or 2 I believe.

### Suicide Squad

**Which Suicide Squad series to read?**

Looking for recommendations on which Suicide Squad series I should read and maybe why?

Suicide Squad 2011
New Suicide Squad 2014
Suicide Squad Rebirth
or the current Suicide Squad run

Also - is the current run a continuation from Rebirth?

7: **The Ostrander one** from the 80s is the classic one.

5: **Ostrander’s run**

And the *current stuff*

Check out Gail Simone’s Secret Six as well, it’s not the Squad, but conceptually it’s the same idea, just no bombs in people’s heads.

> 4: Agreed on Secret Six, it has the same vibe and is better than most of the Squad runs out there.

2: 100% read *the current run*. It’s amazing

> 1: Do you mean with the current run only the ones under the DCU label or also the run from Rebirth included?

> 2: The current run. I only read a few issues of the Rebirth run, so I can’t really speak for it. Someone else might be able to help with that. The crossover “Justice League Vs Suicide Squad” was fun & had amazing artwork from Jason Fabok. Sorry I can’t be more help. But everything since the new 52 is all in the same timeline

2: Definitely the current suicide squad run as it’s one of the best in recent memory. The first four volumes of the rebirth run are good too but after that it really drops off. I also second the suggestion for reading Gail Simone’s Secret Six. It’s probably the best out of them all (TBD on the current run because it’s so early on) even though it doesn’t carry the suicide squad title but is still very comparable thematically.

---

**Any good Suicide Squad comics to read? Where can I read more about Deadshot?**

How does the New 52 one compare to the Rebirth one?

8: The only SS run I recommend is **John Ostrander’s**.

> 3: Second this
>
> > 3: **Ostrander's** is the best, I don't think rebirth is that bad either though, I can't say about the N52 as I thought it was so boring I couldn't get past the first 2 volumes

3: Other than **Osterander's run** on Squad maybe don't read anything else. If you want more Deadshot however, go read Gail Simone's Secret Six it's been recollected into a big thick set of 4 omnibi (i guess that's the correct term). The New 52 run of Secret Six dose not feature Deadshot but is a nice continuation of that books style with a mostly new cast also

1: **Ostrander’s SS run** is excellent and still the gold standard but the first 20 or so issues of the New 52 Suicide Squad were also decent.

The series took a nosedive after Ales Kot left and Suicide Squad became “Tie-In Squad” for every major New 52 event, eventually leading to its cancelation / rebranding in “New Suicide Squad,” which was unspectacular.

1: Secret Six!

---

**Any good Suicide Squad comics to read? Where can I read more about Deadshot?**

How does the New 52 one compare to the Rebirth one?

7: Read the 1987 **John Ostrander and Kim Yale series**, then the 4 or so issues Ales Kot did during the new 52. If you want to keep going after that then stop reading Suicide Squad and start COPRA.

> 2: [COPRA](https://www.comixology.com/Copra/comics-series/63828?ref=c2VhcmNoL2luZGV4L2Rlc2t0b3Avc2xpZGVyTGlzdC90b3BSZXN1bHRzU2xpZGVy).
>
> It's Suicide Squad with the serial numbers filed off.

5: Nothing really compares to the **John Ostrander original series**.

If you're a fan of Deadshot try Gail Simone's Secret Six though as that has a similar feel and concept to the best Suicide Squad stories.

> 2: I would recommend #15 of Simone's S6 run inparticular as it's guest written by Ostrander and centres on Deadshot

4: As was said, you're better off with the **1987 series**, and don't miss the Deadshot: Beginnings miniseries by Ostrander and Yale, which takes place after Suicide Squad (1987) #18.

2: Ostrander and Kim Yale wrote a Deadshot run as well.

1: The last story arc of the current suicide squad run focused on him pretty heavily.

1: I think Ostranders run is the best, but I’ve been enjoying rebirth quite a bit as well

### Swamp Thing

7: Len Wein's *Roots of the Swamp Thing* collects the first appearances of Swampy and establishes some of the main characters that would be used later. Then, move on to the first volume of Alane Moore's **Saga of the Swamp Thing** and work your way up to the sixth volume.

10: *New 52's* (I think he means Swamp Thing by Snyder) not a bad place to start, although Alan Moore's run is a better place to start (and also just better in general).

---

16: Moore's run redefined the character and is held up as the gold-standard.

Other than that, the recent series by Snyder and then Soule was pretty good.

I also think Nancy Collins run is underrated.

7: Moore's run is not only the best Swap Thing run but also one of the best comic book series ever. Some issues read similar to a prose novel. I honestly don't think there's anything quite like it.

5: Besides the obvious, I would recommend the original Len Wein run, collected in *Roots of the Swamp Thing* and if you want that plus all of pre-Moore Bronze Age Swamp Thing material (besides crossovers) it's all been collected in one of those [new monster omnibuses.](https://www.amazon.com/Swamp-Thing-Bronze-Omnibus-Vol/dp/1401273785) The run preceding Moore's does have plot elements that Moore follows on, so it might give you more of an appreciation for his stuff.

1: I feel the Moore run doesn't really have as much weight behind it without having read any of the previous stuff. At the very least read either the "Dark Genesis" or "Roots of the Swamp Thing" trade first so you can get context for his relationships with Abby and Anton, along with Matthew Cable. After that, you can probably jump to the first Saga of the Swamp Thing trade without missing much.

> Both have the 1st appearance of ST, along with the first 10 or 13 issues respectively.
>
> Apparently there's also a collection called Swamp Thing - Bronze Age and the first volume has the same material of "Roots", but it has a different title.
>
> Boy, I wonder why people have problems getting into comic books.

---

16: Start with Book One and read the subsequent trades. Alan Moore started writing the series at #20 and <u>wrapped up the previous writer’s storyline</u>. #21 (The Anatomy Lesson) is where the series starts to become an all-time great.

Don’t get thrown off too much by the numbering. I’ve never read #1-19 and it’s never affected my enjoyment of the series.

> It's all confusing, I know, but that's why most new reader advice avoids talking about all of this. I usually just say "Here, read this" instead of info-dumping about how the entire industry works. That's another reason publisher's label comics as "Book One". There should be no confusion about which book to buy first—it's book 1. Only the more inquisitive readers like yourself notice the comic numbering and think "Am I buying the right thing?" At that point, the publisher is thinking "Ugh, the Book One thing wasn't clear enough. Maybe we should just get rid of the comic numbering altogether to make it more obvious for the newbies." But then consumers would outcry "Now we can't see which issues are collected in this book! CROOKERY!" Again, more confusing meta-info a new reader doesn't need to worry about.

### Wonder Woman

> [Definitive Wonder Woman Collecting Guide and Reading Order](https://crushingkrisis.com/crushing-comics-guide-collecting-dc-comic-books/wonder-woman-collecting-guide-trade-reading-order/#wonder-woman-1987).

5: *The omnibus by Perez*

*Rucka's run* is starting to be reprinted this month

Simone's run is OOP but comes after Rucka's and can be bought on Comixology

New 52 Volumes 1-6 then skip straight to *Rebirth*

Legend of Wonder Woman

Earth One

2: Everything Rucka is a good start

---

> [Good feminist DC comics for birthday present?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/9c8uo4/good_feminist_dc_comics_for_birthday_present/) Wonder Woman seems to have a lot of hit or miss depending on the run itself but she did like wonder woman’s Down to Earth by Greg Rucka. - 
>
> 8: If you want something intellectually feminist, it's a little counter-intuitive, but some of the older WW stuff might be more interesting than the new. Obviously the book is more aware and politically correct now (because of the time), but it's in exchange for when it was actually pretty radical and progressive.
>
> While I don't mean the original bondage-heavy comics (which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?), but for instance the Perez run (1986). This is actually the genesis of 'modern' WW as most people know her. Perez is highly credited by Patty Jenkins for inspiration for the movie (his name is credited 2nd only to Marston). He also had an influential female editor (Karen Berger), and it set the tone for a lot of her ongoing themes: for instance Rucka's embassy-based run (which you mention) was echoing Perez's diplomatic mission from Themyscira to the UN. There's also an issue that presents basically an academic deconstruction of the Pandora myth (as period Greek anti-feminism) in comic form.
>
> Going back to Marston, if she'd *like* the kinkier aspects of that transgressive history of the character, you might also look for Wonder Woman: Earth One by Grant Morrison. These are graphic novels so there's less difficulty collecting trades and making sure you don't miss things, but they essentially re-interpret some of those WMM-era sexual politics with beautiful modern art.
>
> > > which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?
> >
> > They've been reprinted in [Wonder Woman: The Golden Age](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401274447/), with volume 2 coming out [in December.](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401285368/)
> >
> > And I second the Perez recommendation, what I've read of his Wonder Woman is great.
>
> 4: Wonder Woman by Azzarello, Rucka, Simone, and Morrison. Mera got a book not too long ago. Birds of Prey by Simone. Renee Montoya as the Question. Batwoman Elergy or vol 1-4 of the new 52. Not exactly feminist, but Harley Quinn Mad Love, the Kesel run (heh, star wars) or the new 52 title.
>
> 2: My favorites are Wonder Woman (Rucka, Simone, and Azzarello are all great in different ways), Batwoman (the first set of books, by Williams), and anything with a good Lois. The Stephanie Brown Batgirl run is also good in that you get to see both Steph taking on Batgirl and Babs grappling with her role as unwilling mentor.
>
> 1: Wonder Woman Earth One by Grant Morrison and Yannick Paquette. Feminist in a ridiculously radical way imo. The art is absolutely gorgeous though.

---

9: So with her if you are just starting out at as a reader, I recommend the Rebirth Run by Greg Rucka. It even has a Year One Origin Story, and that will give you a good idea of where she’s at in the present day.

So if you are okay with skipping around and reading some past runs, I recommend the *Runs by George Perez*, Greg Rucka’s first run (he had two, one from rebirth and one from the mid 2000’s), and Gail Simone’s Run.

*George Perez’s Wonder Woman Run* is the definitive WW Run, all of the important aspects of Wonder Woman were basically developed here.

If you still want to read more, I would say catch up with her Run Rucka Rebirth Run, it’s on issue 77 I think?

Lastly, Brian Azzarello’s Run from the New 52 is pretty good, it has its problems imo, but I think it reads fine on its own.

1: If you are after the Classic-feel and understanding of the character: You should read the *George Perez-relaunch* from 1986 because it defines the character as she is today, everything everyone else does is measured against that run.

Other good runs in this classic era includes the *first run by Greg Rucka* and arguably that of Gail Simone (though it is rather light). There are also certain one-off stories that may be good to start on: The Heiketia (also by Rucka), League of One, and Who is Wonder Woman are all worth checking out.

Then you have the reboot from 2011, Wonder Woman was reset a little harder than the other big names of DC, but if you are into a book with more of a horror bent than traditional superhero action, the Azzarello run should be on your reading list. (I maintain it was one of the best written books of the New 52 that had a definitive beginning, middle and end that wasn't derailed by what other people were doing).
*Rucka's Rebirth* story is also well written, but I would honestly stick with the Year One story, the Lies wasn't that good because it just felt more like Rucka doing a reintroduction of the characters he created and used in his first run, while basically flushing out what everyone else had done in between (for better or worse).

---

So, this is going to be not a very short list, since I tend to mention a lot of stuff (though it's still considerably shorter than a Superman or Batman list). I'll start with a complete look into all the recommended stuff, with comments on which ones are good starting points.

- *Wonder Woman by Perez* - This is a classic run, a favourite for many. It was where I started reading WW. It is a good introduction to the character and the lore. However since you're new, you might not care for the old style, due to which you can leave this for later.
- *Wonder Woman by Rucka (1st run)* - This is the best WW run according to many. Highly recommended. Good entry point.
- Wonder Woman by Azzarello - This one is a bit divisive, since there are quite a few changes to the character and the lore. I like to think of it as an alternate take on the character rather than a main universe one.
- *Wonder Woman (Rebirth) by Rucka* - This is probably the best starting point. Very well received.
- Wonder Woman by Simone - Another really good Wonder Woman run.
- Wonder Woman by Jimenez - This is not as well-known as the other runs, but it has some fun stuff. Check it out later if you need more of WW.
- Legend of Wonder Woman - I haven't read it but I've heard really good things.
- JLA: A League of One - This one might sound like a JL story but is more of a Wonder Woman story.

TL;DR - Start with Rebirth. After that check out any of Rucka, Perez, Simone or Azzarello, and then other stuff

### X-Men

**Essential X-men read**

What are the story arcs any comic fans should have read about the x-men ?

So far my list: **Dark Phoenix**, Days of Future Past, the start of X-factor.

7: In addition to what you've got, I'd say:

- Proteus
- Wolverine by Claremont and Miller
- God Loves, Man Kills
- From the Ashes
- Asgardian Wars
- Mutant Massacre
- Fall of the Mutants
- Inferno
- Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men

And if you like New Mutants stuff too, Demon Bear is a classic.

2:

- What others have said. Basically almost the entirety of **Claremont's initial run** on X titles. X-men/Uncanny, New Mutants (I can't recommend this enough, and it gets left off a lot of lists), and Excalibur (an X adjacent book, but well worth it).
- Also X-Factor v1 like you've got
- Actually, I'd say continue reading the 90's up through Age of Apocalypse.
- Then you can skip to *Morrison's New X-men.*
- Go to *Whedon's Astonishing X-men*
- There's a number of pretty good secondary books during this time. New X-men: Academy X by DeFilippis and Weir/Kyle and Yost for a school setting. X-Factor v3 by David (an all time great read).
- After that, it's a lot of event focused stuff. Messiah Complex, Utopia era in Uncanny is pretty good. I really enjoyed Cable vol 2 which follows up on Messiah Complex. Uncanny X-Force by Remender. More events, etc.

1: I know it's way too costly, but I would almost say to get the 3 Omnibusses and read **Claremont's run** from it's start to it's 'end'. Those 3 would take you from issue 94 to 175 I believe which is about half his run. There are better storylines than others throughout his run (and some not so good issues as well) but I would see Claremont's original run as a saga. And the better storylines carry more weight as you read all the comics because things happen to characters you have become accustomed to and care about.

Like I said it would cost a lot, but if you're going after all the great storyline trades anyway, and if you already know you like the comic, I 'd just say get them all. Because for every Dark Phoenix saga, there's the Genosha storyline. For every Mutant Massacre there's the Siege Perilious run. Which aren't so well known, but are still good stories. There's a reason why Claremont's original run is looked at with lovey dovey eyes by most comic fans.

If the cost is (understandebly) too much, or if the Omnibusses aren't available even, two of my favourite ones are:

From the Ashes which features some amazing (and short lived) art by Paul Smith. The art plus the era (around the time when Rogue joined for the 1st time) is one of my favourites.

Asgardian Wars One of the most fun 'crossovers' where the X visits Asgard. Which features fantastic art by Art Adams.

------

You can jump ahead to the beginning of each section and start reading with little to zero previous knowledge. This guide is intended for new readers to the series. It goes over many of the main story arcs, but not every single one. It sticks very close to the main titles, and is nowhere near to all there is to read in the X-Universe. Each section also includes an optional section to help get you started in the extended X-Universe. I know a franchise like X-Men can be daunting to jump into, and I hope this entices you get reading.

------

The Original X-Men (1963-70) & Modern Retellings

------

This is the very beginning, and you’ll need no previous knowledge to start at this point. This era is different than most because you have multiple options when starting with stories of the original team of X-Men.

- Your first option would be to read some of the original issue of X-Men. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the X-Men in 1963. I would say a good intro to the series would be the first 20-25 issues. These first two dozen issues aren’t very important later on down the line, but they do introduce characters that will be with us for all of X-Men’s history. Read this if you’ve read other SIlver Age comics or if you’re just adamant on reading every issue.
- Secondly, we have a more modern take on Silver Age stories. It is a three volume series called X-Men First Class. It is a standalone series from the mid 2000’s that follows the original five X-Men in some all-ages adventure. This series is perfect for kids and adults looking to get into the series. Between all three volumes it is around 30 issues, but they read a lot faster than the old SIlver Age comics. You’d probably get through these faster than the original Lee/Kirby run.
- Lastly, your final option would be a graphic novel from 2012 called X-Men: Season One. If you’re in a hurry, then this is the quickest way to read about the original X-Men. Similar to First Class, it’s a modern take on early stories of the X-Men. It retells the first few issues from the Lee/Kirby run through the eyes of Jean Grey.

From here you can move on to the next section or take a look at one or more optional arcs that each section will have. They’re not essential, but they will introduce you to more facets of the X-Men universe.

------

*OPTIONAL: If you want to continue on reading the original series after the first 20 to 25 issues, you can either continue reading the all the silver age issue up to #66. X-Men is put into reprint until 1975 when the title relaunches with a new creative team aka the Claremont era.*

------

***The Chris Claremont Era (1975-1991)***

------

This is the start of Chris Claremont's time on the book. While Stan Lee and Jack Kirby invented the X-Men, Chris brought them back from obscurity and perfected them. He is on the book for 17 straight years, and his whole run is basically one very long story. Some of his characters and plot points still have lasting effects in comics that are being released today. It's best to read it all in order, but I broke it up a bit for those who want to jump around.

No matter where in Chris’ run you decide to start reading, I recommend that you all read Giant-Size X-Men #1. While Chris didn’t write this issue, it is the jumping off point for this era. Many popular X-Men are introduced included Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Storm, and Colossus.

After that you’ve got a few options as far as starting points (there may be some overlapping):

- As I mentioned earlier read Giant-Size X-Men #1 first!
- The first era of Chris’ run includes the storylines like The Phoenix Saga, **The Dark Phoenix Saga**, Proteus, and Days of Future Past. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #94-143. Issue #94 picks up right where Giant-Size X-Men #1 left off.
- Chris’ second era on the books begins when Kitty Pryde joins the team and Jean Grey had died after becoming Dark Phoenix. You’ll see the storylines: Mutant Massacre, Fall of the Mutants, and Inferno. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #139-243. (Note that some arcs crossover with other X-Men titles).
- The end of Chris’ era as he abruptly leaves Marvel in 1991. This section includes the introduction of Gambit and Jubilee. It also includes the storylines X-Tinction Agenda and The Muir Island Saga. The reading order is Uncanny X-Men (v1) #244-280 and X-Men (v2) #1-3. (Note that some arcs crossover with other X-Men Titles).

------

*OPTIONAL: God Loves, Man Kills: This is a standalone graphic novel that was written during this era. It's widely regarded as one of the best X-Men stories of all time. It was the inspiration for the second X-Men movie.*

------

*OPTIONAL: From here Claremont left Marvel. He was supposed to take over this new X-Men title, but it was moved over to other writers after he left. If you want to read more about what Chris would have done after #3 then read series' X-Men Forever and X-Men Forever 2. Fair warning, those were ended before he could finish up all of his plot threads.*

------

X-Men in the 90’s (1991-2001)

------

After Chris leaves Marvel in the early 90's, we see a period where the now two main X-Men titles HEAVILY cross over with each other. The best place to start is with either X-Men (v2) #1 or Uncanny X-Men (v1) #281. These are the two main titles during the whole decade and they crossover with each other a lot. Just pick a starting point and keep an eye out at the end of each issues to see what you should be reading next (it almost always says where to go if it's not the next issues in the series you're reading).

------

*OPTIONAL: Age of Apocalypse is a self contained story that takes place in an alternate universe. It’s collected into to four trade paperbacks, but it’s almost universally accepted that you can skip Vol. 1. Read Vol. 2 through Vol. 4 for a more cohesive story.*

------

*Start of the Modern Era (2001-2004)*

------

Grant Morrison took over X-Men (v2) in 2001 and it was renamed *New X-Men* for his entire time on the title. X-Men, and Marvel in general, was struggling in the ninties. This title brough X-Men back from the grave. It is what brought X-Men into the modern era of comics and is highly regarded on of the best complete runs on an X-Men title since Claremont left Marvel after X-Men (v2) #3

Read in this order:

- *New X-Men #114-154*

------

*OPTIONAL: Chris Claremont started a new X-Men comic around this time called X-Treme X-Men (v1). It's not as great as his earlier work, but if you're a fan after reading his first run, then it may be worth checking this out.*

------

*Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men (2004-2008)*

------

This is a direct response to Grant Morrison's run on New X-Men, and it is just as highly regarded. Whedon is a huge fan of X-Men, and it really shows with this book. Unlike New X-Men, instead of renaming one of the main books, Astonishing is a brand new book that runs separate from the current X-Books isn’t included in any events or crossover (at least during the Whedon run). Read in this order:

- Astonishing X-Men #1 - 24
- Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1

------

*OPTIONAL: Warren Ellis takes over creative control of this comic after Whedon leaves and is also a decent read. He writes the title from #25-35 and also for the mini-series Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis #1–5.*

------

The House of M, M-Day, and the Mutant Messiah (2005-2011)

------

This section is basically going to be a whole bunch of mini-series and crossovers. They all fit in really well together, and they're super important in the X-Men and Marvel universe as a whole. The events here set the stage for a huge shift in the X-Universe.

Reading order:

- House of M mini series
- Messiah Complex Crossover
- Cable (v2) #1-12
- Messiah War Crossover
- Cable (v2) #16-24
- Second Coming Crossover
- Schism mini series

------

*NOTE: Most would say that Cable (v2) issues are optional, but I highly recommend them. They make the story a little more complete in my opinion.*

------

*OPTIONAL: Mike Carey has a great 7 year run on X-Men Legacy (aka X-Men v2) during this time period. His issues crossover with most of the X-Men events of the time, but for the most part it's easy to follow. Read in this order: X-Men (v2) #188-204, X-Men Legacy #208-216, X-Men Original Sin crossover (not related to Original Sin 2014), X-Men Legacy #219-225, #238-248, Age of X crossover, and X-Men Legacy #249-260*

------

*OPTIONAL: Uncanny X-Force (v1) by Rick Remender is one of the most celebrated X-books in recent history. It’s largely self-contained, check out #1 - 35.*

------

Avengers Vs. X-Men and Marvel NOW Relaunch (2012-present)

------

Avengers Vs. X-Men isn't apart of the Marvel NOW relaunch, but it's a very important plot element that directly affects the X-Men Marvel NOW titles.

What you need to know beforehand: Scarlet Witch altered reality by deleting the X-Gene from all but 198 mutants. After a while the first mutant, Hope, was finally born. After running through time for 16 years with Cable to protect her, Hope comes back to the present as a young woman. She is now believed to be the new host for the Phoenix. Also during that time, Cyclops and Wolverine split the X-Men into two separate factions.

Reading order:

- Avengers Vs X-Men mini-series
- All-New X-Men #1-15
- Uncanny X-Men (v3) #1-11
- Battle of the Atom Crossover
- All New X-Men #18-21
- The Trial of Jean Grey Crossover
- All New X-Men #25-37
- Black Vortex Crossover
- Uncanny X-Men #14 - 35
- All-New X-Men #40 - 41
- Uncanny X-Men #600 (been delayed, will be released soon)

------

*OPTIONAL: After you read "The Trial of Jean Grey", you can then start on Cyclops (v3) #1. This is the space adventures of young Cyclops from the past, his space-pirate father Corsair, and his team.*

------

***Congratulations, if you've read everything on the list, you are now a X-Men X-pert!***

2: So I just found this post, and decided to start with Claremont's stuff in the 70's.

I found a couple omnibuses on Amazon, and wanted to make sure they're the right ones.

[Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Uncanny-X-Men-Omnibus-Volume-Printing/dp/0785185690)

[Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785185720/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687722&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0785185690&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1Z48QYQ9SWNMKGBBEKQT)

Am I headed in the right direction with these two?

I also found [this one](http://www.amazon.com/X-Men-Chris-Claremont-Jim-Omnibus/dp/0785158227/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=02595D4KMZQVG46XV9AW), but I'm not sure where it ties in with everything.

> 2: Those first two are a perfect jumping on point! Happy reading!

1: What about Claremont's Nightcrawler book?

> 3: No, I wouldn't recommend that for a total beginner. This is a guide to for some of the major core books/stories with some of my optional personal recommendations mixed in.

**Where to start with X-Men comics?** (Apr 02 2017)

I'd like to start reading X-Men comics. After collecting decades worth of amazing Spider-Man books, I've discovered the immense difference between good starting points, and bad ones. Anyone got a good place to start that also has good stories and writing?

11: X-Men Prime #1. It came out this week and it acts as the starting point for all the new series coming in the next few months. You picked a great time to start reading X-Men.

> 6: if you read the good stuff before you read this, you'll be disappointed. if you read this, and then go the Claremont route you'll be more satisfied.

5: I'd suggest New X-Men #1. Morrison's run is killer, which then feeds into Whedon's which is my personal favorite.

Plus it doesn't dwell too much on backstory and works with new plots and villains so you don't feel like you're starting in the middle of a story.

> 7: New X-Men technically starts at 114!

5: If you can handle [1970's writing/art](http://i.imgur.com/CxsGq91.png):

- **Uncanny X-Men** by Chris Claremont

If not:

- *New X-Men* by Grant Morrison
- *Astonishing X-Men* by Joss Whedon (Swap this with New X-Men for a more consistent/fun intro to X-Men.)
- House of M by Brian Michael Bendis (Event includes important X-Men status quo change.)

1: UNCANNY X-MEN #1 heh, check comicbookherald. he'll point you in the right direction.

1: You can get caught up on most of the X continuity with the podcast Jay and Miles X-plain the X-men. It is a fantastic way to catch up and very entertaining. They gloss over the silver age stuff for the most part but the silver age was kinda shit anyway

*1: New X-men by Morrison*. See that period? I put a period there on purpose. Also Remender's Uncanny X-Force.

---

**Where should I start reading the X-men comics?**

I have been thinking about start reading the X-Men, but I do not wish to start reading everything from issue number one. I would like to read the comic books/ graphic novels that made you like the characters or the ones that are your favourites. If it is any indication, I liked the films and Wolverine is my favourite character.

9: Uncanny X-Men returns next week with a brand new #1. It will be weekly for the first 10 issues then settle into a more normal release schedule.

Return of Wolverine is on issue 2 and features the first Logan story since he died a few years back.

Brand new X-Force series is starting next month that looks pretty promising.

As far as older stuff, if you want to you could just read both volumes (4 issues) of X-Men: Grand Design. That will get you caught up on the first 25ish years of X-Men history.

8: I only really got into comics a couple of years ago (mostly due to the canon Star Wars series). I to was worried about jumping into the comics especially X-men given the history. Similarly, I prefer reading graphic novels.

I would highly recommend *Grant Morrisons "New X-men"* (collected in 3 ultimate comic trades). I found it an excellent way to really get a feel for the X-men world and all the the characters.

- great abundance of X-men characters, so you can se who you like or not. You have your classics like Jean, Wolverine and Cyclops. Plus, some of the more modern era characters like Emma Frost and Fatomex. And over the run you get cameos from Storm, Polaris, L'landra etc.
- the writing is modern (say compared to something like Dark Pheonix, which is also a must read)
- very unique stories, from psychic parasite to telepaths affairs: there is a great issue that has no dialogue. It really changed my opinion on superhero comics can be, which up till that point I always felt like were more "Saturday morning cartoons" (not that that bad at all).
- and while subjective. I think the art work is beautiful.

I would also recommend *Josh Whedons Ashtonsining X-men*. It's follows up where New X-men left off.

I would also say, don't worry about continuty or chronological order. As someone who was used to the strict canon is Star Wars comics, I found it impossible to try to bring order to the xmen continuity. Just pick a run that sounds interesting to you and read it as it own contained story.

2: Essential:

- God Loves, Man Kills
- Proteus / **Dark Phoenix Saga**
- Days of Future Past
- Claremont/Miller Wolverine
- From the Ashes
- *Whedon's Astonishing*
- Remender's Uncanny X-Force
- Old Man Logan

2: Oh I forgot Wolverine: Meltdown. Incredible art. Wolverine & Havok causing trouble down in Mexico.

If you like the movie Logan (of course you do) & want more X-23, check out X-23: Innocence Lost & Target X (in The Complete Collection Vol. 1) -- X-23's origin story.

---

**I want to start reading x-men Comics**

15: X-men Grand Design. Kinda goes over the history of the X-men. Could probably be the quickest way to get caught up on the comic history. It's getting really good reviews too. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/X-Men-Grand-Design-Ed-Piskor/dp/1302904892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526947532&sr=8-1&keywords=x-men+grand+design&dpID=516BMFZsd6L&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch#reader_B07BH4DM7T).

13: *Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men* is very good

12: Giant Size X-Men #1.

> 6: Can't go wrong with starting on **Chris Claremonts runs** on X-Men.

12: Gonna catch flack but *Grant Morrison’s New X-Men is beautiful.*

> 7: I think Morrison's New X-Men is by far the best place to start, especially for adults. It's my favorite run, and I don't know if it can ever be topped

5: There are a lot of good jumping on points in X-Men comics. The first is Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's original run, starting with X-Men #1 (1963). I wouldn't really recommend this, though: it is easily among the weakest of their work and is kind of hard to get through at times.

The next great jumping on point is **Chris Claremont's legendary run**. It begins with Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975) and continues in X-Men #94. This run spawned several spin offs, including New Mutants and X-Factor. You mainly don't have to read these to keep up with just X-Men but there are a few crossovers once you get to the mid #200s.

**Claremont's run** ended in 1991, but personally I wouldn't say this is a good jumping-on point, as what comes next mostly follows on from his run and you will probably be confused going forward from here (again, just my opinion).

The next jumping-on point would be *Grant Morrison's New X-Men*, which starts with issue #114 (2001). This was written as a starting point for new X-fans and is really the beginning of the "modern" X-Men. His run is followed by *Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men* #1 (2004).

These are the starting points I would recommend, although there are numerous other X-Men series that you could read, as well as about a million solo series. Let me know if you need any help with reading orders.

4: **Uncanny X-Men** #1, 1963.

You'll eventually need a spreadsheet to keep everything together but it's fun starting continuity and reading all the way through, especially as more books get added.

3: [Here's](http://crushingkrisis.com/definitive-guide-to-collecting-x-men-as-graphic-novels/collecting-x-men-1-93-comic-books-as-graphic-novels/) the website I used to start reading X-Men

2 (Gold Award - what?): Obligatory plug for [Jay & Miles X-plain the X-men](http://www.xplainthexmen.com/), a podcast that puts out ~one hour episodes weekly, explaining the plots, backstories, cross-references, etc. from the very beginning of the franchise. Right now they're up to the very early '90s.

They mix it up with occasional interviews with creators (they actually got Chris Claremont on once!) and strange bonus episodes (in one they explained the promotional X-men comics distributed by Pizza Hut).

If you don't start from the very beginning (and there are very good reasons not to do so), it's an excellent way to get all that backstory. It also gives you some of the story behind the story, like how different writers' perspectives led to certain jarring discontinuities.

P.S. If you want to know where to start, you need to give us some more information. It's like saying, "I want to get into some new music, what's good?" I can start recommending bands, but if I don't know what tickles your fancy, I'm stabbing blind.

Do you like gritty suffering? jaunty quips? romance? political thrillers? anatomically improbable hair? Do you want some fan service (and do you have a preference on the skimpily clothed drawings' gender?) or would you rather that characters be more realistic in their proportions? Did you like the 90s cartoon? X-men evolution? Did you like the old movies? the new ones? What other comics / books do you like?

Are there characters you definitely want to see? Ones that you find awkward or cringeworthy? (Mojo is an example of pretty divisive dude.)

And so on.

2: For a beginner I suggest reading "all new X-men"(2012) to get your feet wet in the universe so you can go back and foward through all the stories, it has stories from the original stan lee/jack kirby 1963 **Uncanny X-men** and Fills in claremont's 80's and 90s X-men. And it will get you used to the "new" Bendis(the writer) style writing that's been going since the 2000's.

I personally recommend that you get Marvel unlimited, It's a Netflix like service by Marvel that let's you read all their comics since the 60's to the new comics from this year. It's only $6 per month for the yearly or $9 for the month. it also lets you read the comics offline using the app on mobile. It's been great for me since i get to have all 57 years of X-men in my pocket to read.

2: *New X-Men* by Grant Morrison is great. I just read it a few weeks ago (my first X-Men comic), and I wasn't lost at all

2: As a devil's advocate, to contrast with the people recommending *Morrison's New X-Men* -- I didn't think it was very good at all, and I think it's a terrible place to start.

2: H<u>ere are my favorite story arcs, in chronological order</u>:

1. Proteus (**Uncanny 125-128**) -- their first really dangerous enemy; intro to Dark Phoenix. I highly recommend the trade paperback which has some great additional stories
2. **Dark Phoenix Saga** (**Uncanny 129-137**) -- widely considered one of the best X-men stories ever. Must-read for Jean Grey fans.
3. Days of Future Past (**Uncanny 141-142**) -- Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future
4. God Loves, Man Kills (graphic novel) -- possibly the best place for a newcomer to start (graphic novel so it's okay if you read it out of order)
5. The Brood Saga **(Uncanny 154-158, 161-167**) -- a mix of Alien & The Matrix, includes the first meeting of Magneto & Professor X (#161) and the first meeting of the X-men & Rogue
6. Wolverine (Claremont/Miller limited series 1-4) -- the first Wolverine comics, must-read
7. From the Ashes (**Uncanny 168-176**) -- one of Joss Whedon's favorite runs; Wolverine's wedding; Rogue joins the X-Men; Storm gets a mohawk
8. Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown (limited series 1-4) -- highly recommended, great artwork
9. X-Treme X-Men: Mekanix -- must-read for Kitty Pryde fans.
10. *Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men* run 1-24 (the Warren Ellis run after this is also good). The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix.
11. X-23: Innocence Lost & Target X (in The Complete Collection Vol. 1) -- X-23's origin story.
12. X-Force Vol. 1 & 2 (Kyle & Yost)
13. Uncanny X-Force Vol. 1 (Remender)
14. Old Man Logan (Mark Millar)
15. Magneto (Bunn)

2: Okay, so, a little while back, Marvel relaunched their lineup of X-Men comics (not rebooted, just started a fresh set of series'). This is the ResurrXion lineup, and it's the best jumping on point you could ask for. Each series follows a different team or character, and just about every flavor of X-Men is represented currently.

X-Men Blue is still ongoing and shares the dual-flagship role with X-Men Gold. It follows the time-displaced Original 5 X-Men (Cyclops, Jean, Iceman, Beast, and Angel; plus a couple of eventual additions to the team, both hailing from alternate universes), under the mostly-reformed Magneto's guidance, going on various missions. It's much more focused on the high-concept sci-fi side of X-Men, and features a variety of villains.

X-Men Gold is also still ongoing, and is the second, and follows Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Old Man Logan (old, alt. universe Wolverine), Rachel Grey, and Storm, with Kitty leading, based out of the X-Mansion (now located in Central Park). It's definitely got tons of sci-fi stuff, but there's also focus on the moral/political side of the mutant struggle. Also features many villains, and a little bit ago spent some with its focus shifted to post-solo series Iceman and some other X-Men, including Rogue.

Generation X is now finished and follows a group of X-students dealing with more grounded threats and navigating their own internal and interpersonal struggles: Hindsight, Quentin Quire, Benji Deeds, Bling!, Nature Girl, and Eye-Boy. Jubilee is their mentor/teacher, and Chamber is her main supporter.

Iceman, also now finished, follows Adult Iceman (though it briefly features Young Iceman too) as he comes to terms with his sexuality, both internally and with regards to other people, while also dealing with a series of villains and grounded threats.

Jean Grey follows O5 Jean as she learns the Phoenix Force is returning and prepares to face it by getting training and advice from the likes of Psylocke, Thor, and the various former Phoenix hosts, including Emma Frost. It leads into Phoenix Resurrection, which deals with the return of the original Jean Grey. Both are finished.

*Astonishing X-Men*, still ongoing, follows Psylocke, Archangel, Old Man Logan, Bishop, Mystique, Gambit, and Fantomex as they deal with a major attack by Shadow King. Involves the return of a major X-Men character.

X-Men Red, only recently begun, follows the now-returned original Jean Grey and her new team (Nightcrawler, X-23 Wolverine, Honey Badger, Namor, Gentle, Gambit, and a new character called Trinary) as they try to carry out Jean's plan to create a better world for mutants and humans alike, while dealing with Cassandra Nova. Definitely more focus for the social commentary aspect of X-Men.

The New Mutants: Dead Souls, also only just started, follows Magik, Boom Boom, Rictor, Strong Guy, and Wolfsbane as they work for Karma's new humanitarian company, Hatchi Corporation, as superpowered, paranormal investigators.

There are other series', like Cable (which gets rather good after a bizarrely bland first 5 issues and is still ongoing), Rogue & Gambit (which has quite decent action and character work, and just finished), Exiles (technically not a ResurrXion book, but still an X-book, and quite good fun), Legion, Domino, Old Man Logan, All-New Wolverine, and Weapon X (those last five I haven't kept up with).

The ones I'd recommend most are, in order, Blue, Gen X, Gold, Iceman, and *Astonishing*, with Jean Grey/Phoenix Resurrection and Red close behind. Hope this helps!

**What is the best x-men comics?**

Which X-men comic should i read? Is the uncanny x men good?

15: **Uncanny X-Men (1963) #94-279 by Chris Claremont**

*New X-Men (2001)* #115-154 by Grant Morrison

*Astonishing X-Men (2004)* #1-24 by Joss Whedon

> 2: Don't forget the Giant Sized Issue for Whedon and Claremont. I need to read these all though.

8: Remender's Uncanny X-Force. David's X-Factor (2006).

> 4: These two and Whedon's Astonishing X-Men are my favorites.
>
> As for something more recent, X-Men Red is kicking all kinds of ass.

5: *New X-Men by Morrison* is a pretty great read.

2: Old man logan

2: Just find everything with **Chris Claremont's** name on it and skip everything else. That's the simplest rule of thumb.

1: **Claremont's stuff** is ace. *Morrison* too. *Whedon's stuff* is aight but I prefer the former two.

**Best/essential X-Men comics AFTER House of M/Decimation**

Hey guys. I've been working my way through a bunch of Marvel stuff on MU but I'm particularly into X-Men. I've been going roughly chronologically and read my way through a bunch of Claremont Uncanny X-Men, Morrison's New X-men, Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, House of M and Deadly Genesis. Now I don't really know where the main X-men story goes. I started reading the Kyle and Yost run on New X-Men which is pretty good but has a bunch of new characters I don't know and a lot of reading orders I've seen don't seem to have a clear next step after House of M for X-books.. What are the essential X-comics post-House of M?

9: I liked the Kieron Gillen and Matt Fraction periods of Uncanny a bunch, and Rick Remender’s Uncanny X-Force is a big favorite around here. All-New Wolverine was really good too. And the two new Hickman-written books are (chef’s kiss).

4: I liked X-Men Red by Tom Taylor

3: X-Men (2004) #188-207 by Mike Carey, which becomes X-Men Legacy (2008) #208-275 after Messiah Complex, is a very good and underrated run.

Uncanny X-Men #475–503 by Ed Brubaker picks right up after Deadly Genesis, which leads to Uncanny X-Men #504-534 by Matt Fraction, which leads to Uncanny X-Men #534.1-544 and Uncanny X-Men (2011) #1-20 by Kieron Gillen, and I think that's all good stuff, well worth reading.

> 1 (OP): This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!

#### Cyclops

**What are the best Cyclops Comics** (Dec 28 2013)

I'm really into X-men and have only recently gotten into reading comics. I have read everything from Schism till the Marvel Now Uncanny X-men. What is the best comic of the character though?

28: I can't stress *joss whedon's run on astonishing x-men* enough. He worked wonders with scott summers.

9: He's a total bad-ass in Messiah Complex. Very fast-paced and great read.

> 3: The last issue of that story where Scott presses his head to Cable's gun--best moment of the story. Actually, most of the great moments of that story involve Cyclops.

6: Second Coming, It's not all about Cyclops or anything but it shows him off the best imo.

5: If you can find them get: Marvel comics presents: Cyclops. It was a series that allowed solo limited series for various X-Men. This was during his X-Factor days and it was an 8 part series with him battling Master Mold

4: I'd say the NationX storyline, or really the entire period they were on Utopia. It was one of the most active times in really trying to cement human/mutant relations within the franchises history. And Scott was the main driving force behind the whole thing.

Messiah Complex, War and Second Coming were also really good examples of Cyclops in a heavy leadership role. Not in the boyscout way he was often used in the past, but as someone really fighting a war.

> 2: I agree with all of this! The fight between Scott and Norman Obsorn, Scott really comes out as a badass on so many levels.

3: X-Men #138. While I can't say he's at his best here, it is a fascinating look into Cyclops.

And as said before, Messiah Complex, Utopia, and Second Coming. Those are some of the best X-men stories of all time I think.

3: Uncanny X-Men #495 gives a real insight into Cyclops' psyche. It's basically Emma Frost describing Scott's mind to Shanna in the Savage Land.

My favorite er with him is when he was the leader of the Blue Team in the Jim Lee years.

One of my favorite (brief) moments from Cyke came in Infinity Gauntlet where he blasts Thanos and then abruptly stops, sending the Mad Titan off balance. Essentially, Scott outmaneuvered god. Then Thanos ends up killing him really quicklike. (This leads to one of my all-time favorite comic moments when all of Earth's heavy hitters fail, Captain America calmly walks up to Thanos, and when Silver Surfer swings and misses to steal the gauntlet, Cap punches god in the face. Epic, but that's probably best saved for a different thread.)

3: I'm gonna go all 90's and say X men vol.2 #44 features Cyclops nicely and reminds everyone why he is an awesome character. I also liked the adventures of cyclops and phoenix.

3: X-men unlimited Vol 1, Number 1 was a great Cyclops story if I remember it correctly

---

**Best Cyclops comics?** (Oct 01 2015)

Hi! I just adore Cyclops (especially after watching Wolverine and the X-Men-- he and Emma were just the best in that show!!) and I want to read the best runs with him in them. Unfortunately, it seems he's almost always a side character. I want more!! I read *Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run* (which is probably what moved me to Team Cyclops in the first place) and *Grant Morrison's run* too, which I thought was hit-or-miss (and was sorely disappointed by the Xorn reveal, such that I think I threw the book across the room) but I liked the little Emma-Jean-Scott mental love triangle. I tried reading the run following Morrison's, but couldn't get through it.

Anyway, I've seen some intriguing stuff on Tumblr, but I don't want to read 10 issues for one great Cyclops moment. So recommend away!! I have Marvel Unlimited so I have almost everything at my fingertips-- if only that app had a more intuitive organizational structure...

Thanks :D

5: Kieron Gillen's Uncanny X-Men run (#534.1-544, #1-20) and Avengers vs X-Men: Consequences. It's the logical conclusion of Cyclops' arc as laid out by Morrison and Whedon.

And yes Chuck Austen's New X-Men is literally the worst.

> 5: I would recommend Matt Fraction's UXM run that precedes Gillen's as well. I think that run is really underrated.
>
> Also, if you haven't been listening to the Rachel and Miles X-Plain the X-Men podcast, you should be.

1: If you haven't read AvX and Consequences, definitely that, you'll probably enjoy the last volume of Uncanny X-Men, the beginning of All-New X-Men up until he leaves the team, and the recent volume with his young time-traveling self that follows him leaving ANXM. The old series The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix is a solid read too for Cyclops fans, as it tells of when the two went to the future to raise Cable.

> 3: The AvX main series and Bendis' Uncanny/All-New are terrible Cyclops comics. Bendis blatantly hates current Cyclops and so makes him completely incompetent.

---

**Best cyclops comics?**

5: It sort of hard to pin down, since <u>a lot of his stories have been attributed to the X-Men team</u> as a whole.

He’s had a few Minis, one in 2001, and one in 2014 (he’s a teen, but he gets to hang out with his dad, so I can’t complain, Corsair is awesome).

*Claremont’s X-Men Run* is probably the best example of him as the de facto leader. *Astonishing* is another good choice to see a well written Cyclops.

4: I liked him a lot in *Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run*. He was pretty badass, and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't like him that much.

1: *New X-Men*->*Astonishing X-Men*-> **Uncanny X-Men** will more or less give you the 21st century arc of Cyclops.

#### Gambit

**Gambit recommendations?**

New to Marvel and comics in general. Gambit is mon cheri because of the X-Men cartoon I watched as a child. I've got an envie for some stories with Gambit. He doesn't have to be the main protagonist. Any story arcs, trade paperbacks, or collected editions y'all might recommend? Merci!

3: Like most to do with X-Men, if the character debuted in **Chris Claremont's run**, then that is the best run to read about them.

Gambit was extremely cool in **Uncanny X-Men** 265-280, but I would start at **Uncanny** 246 to understand everything going on.

3: There was a Gambit solo series by James Asmus a couple years ago that I recall being pretty good. Check that out.

2: There is a new miniseries with him and Rogue by Kelly Thompson

Plus, X-Men Red #3

---

**Best Reading For Gambit**

I’ve just finished the 2012 gambit run and now I need more gambit to fill my gambit needs.

You guys got any recommendations for good gambit runs?

Edit - thanks for the recommendations! I’ll delve in after work!

6: I should really save my comment for this.

Mutant Massacre. He's not in it, but it's important later on.

Read Claremont's Uncanny X-men from 266 to when it splits in to two books.

He's one of the main team members for X-men vol 2 by Nicieza.

Gambit vol. 1 and vol. 2 by Mackie give a lot of backstory for the character.

An AU version leads a team in AoA.

You can skip most of the post-AoA stuff, but make sure to read Trial of Gambit.

Gambit vol. 3 by Nicieza is peak Gambit imo (Nicieza just gets the character like few other writers).

He shows up on occasion in X-Treme X-men by Claremont

Milligan does have an Apocalypse arc where Gambit plays a central role. The character design is cool, but the characterization of Gambit is so so far off the mark by Milligan. Read if you want to I guess.

He shows up a bit in X-men: Legacy by Carey right after Messiah Complex.

I think the next good series featuring him is probably the X-23 solo by Liu.

Then he was featured in All-New X-Factor by David.

Skip ahead, and Astonishing X-men by Soule, X-men: Red by Taylor, Rogue and Gambit by Thompson, and Mr. & Mrs. X by Thompson are the recent series to feature him.

5: Gambit & Rogue mini series, followed by Mr. and Mrs. X. Really great take on him and Rogue.

**Good Gambit stories?**

So I know Gambit is a popular pick for favorite X-Men team member, but I personally don’t get it. What are some great Gambit arcs that’ll make me see what the hype is all about?

8: Big Gambit fan here. He’s a character you either love or hate. As much as I love this man, he’s best in a big ensemble. Like eating hot peppers, it’s best when paired with others. Solo: not so good. That being said, here are my recommendations in ranking order:

X23 series by Marjorie Liu. Particularly the issues with Jubilee and Wolverine. We see Gambit as a mentor and protective older brother type. We get glimpses of the things I love about him- his courage, his love of books, his loyalty, and he even goes out on a date with someone who ISNT Rogue or Bella Donna. Le gasp!

Gambit solo series by James Asmus. The inconsistent art is a bummer because when Clay Mann is on it, he can’t be beaten. However, we see Gambit really standing on his own and making thoughtful decisions about which way his life should go. He gets friends and foes outside the XMen- which is a big plus for me- and his BFF Fence turns out to be a fan favorite.

Finally, if you’re a big Rogue/Gambit shipper, Rogue & Gambit by Kelly Thompson is right up your alley. There’s romance, adventure, comedy. KT is one of Marvels top writers at the moment. In my cynical opinion, her inexperience with life and relationships is obvious the minute you dig into her stories. However, if you’re looking for passion and entertainment, you can’t do better.

If you read any or all of these and still don’t see the big deal, Gambit just isn’t your cup of tea. No shame in that. The XMen has an amazing cast and they all have their own devoted following.

Happy reading!

1: My personal Gambit stories:

Age of Apocalypse: Gambit & The X-Ternals

X-Men: Blood of Apocalypse

Gambit volume 5

X-Men by Mike Carey

X-Men Legacy: Divided We Stand

X-Men Second Coming: Hellbound

1: The 1st Gambit limited with Howard Mackie and Lee Weeks was great. Loved his solobook when it was Nicieza and Scroce on art. But it really was his introduction and 1st couple years that solidified the character. The combination of Claremont and Jim Lee brought forth a compelling, mysterious, yet dangerous character. Gambit really has never been handled that well since, even by Claremont himself in later years. The influence Lee brought to how Gambit was portrayed and written is often over looked and it's unlikely we will ever see those 2 collaborate again for an X-Men project.

Edited to add: if you don't see his appeal now, it's unlikely you will. It's a kind of "you had to be there" type of thing.

1: In X-Men Legacy by Mike Carey he starts out as Xavier’s muscle than becomes more important as the book shifts to Rogue. Great character work

1: Everyone else has given absolutely amazing recommendations, so I'll give something else.

I'm not a fan of Chuck Austen but I think he delivers a pretty good Gambit in Ultimate-universe. It may not be the best story out there, but that rendition of beloved characters gave me a new twist to a classic Rogue/Gambit-story. And it actually pushed me to find more about these characters that were kinda on the sidelines for me. I knew about them, but I had never been so invested in those characters.

Kinda like Injustice-games worked for some people. That storyline rekindled my interest.

So. Ultimate X-men issues 50-53 and the first Ultimate X-men Annual is my pick.

3: The suggestions here are good. I'm not sure it matters what you read first off that list, although **Enemy of the State** is a pretty great "generic Wolverine" story, in that it doesn't CHANGE EVERYTHING FOREVER as much as present a very strong take on the character.

More than most characters, <u>Wolverine is one where you should just read the good stuff</u>. It's not a character that necessarily rewards deep continuity dives, in my opinion--by virtue of being very old in continuity, very popular irl, and having canonical memory loss, they've just crammed in a LOT of backstory over the years that doesn't all fit together very well (...like, depending on who you ask, him and Sabertooth may be descendants of a race of cat-people?)

In addition to what Tigertemprr suggested, the original **Dark Phoenix Saga** has cool wolverine moments, and I think the "Madripoor Nights" arc of the Claremont miniseries is a boatload of fun. I've also always been partial to Greg Rucka's solid (if not spectacular) run on the character before Millar's, although I acknowledge it's nothing must-read.

> the next paragraph is really hard:

The only REAL suggestion I'll make is that after you read the BWS Weapon X, read the original Kyle/Yost X-23 books if you have any interest ("Innocence Lost" and "Target X"). They're very good, and a very direct callback/homage to the original Weapon X, so reading them one after the other is rewarding.

**Best Wolverine Comics?**

2: **Wolverine** by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller is a classic, also I really dug Mark Millar's Wolverine stuff (i.e. **Enemy of the State**).

2: Wolverine (1988) #1-57 is probably the best of his original ongoing series. Features lots of Madripoor and **Weapon X** goodness. Issues written by Chris Claremont, Peter David, and Larry Hama. Some great art by John Buscema and Mark Silvestri.

NOTE: You can just read #1-57, but I'd recommend reading Marvel Comics Presents #1-10 first, and then reading Weapon X by Barry Windsor Smith in-between issues #46 and #47.

1: Please check out *Wolverine by Jason Aaron*. I think he's one of the better writers that did something new with the character! Also it's bloody as hell!!

1: Jason Aaron's *Wolverine: Weapon X* is great (I didn't think his later run on the following *Wolverine* series [The "*Wolverine in Hell*" storyarc] was as good).

Wolverine Epic Collection: Madripoor Nights is also pretty good. It's not typical super-hero stuff, and Logan rarely appears in costume. Since you liked Rucka's run, I think you'll like this as well.

I think the general consensus of Wolverine: Origins (not to be confused with Origin) is to avoid it, but I really liked #16-20 (volume 4). After the death of Captain America Wolverine remembers a mission he shared with him and Bucky during WWII.

**Best Wolverine Comics?**

7: My Recommended Wolverine Reading:

- **Wolverine (1982)**
- **"Weapon X" Marvel Comics Presents (1988)** #72-84
- **"Enemy of the State" Wolverine (2003)** #20-31
- *"Get Mystique" Wolverine (2003)* #62-65
- "A Day in the Life" Wolverine (2003) #73-74
- *"Adamantium Men" Wolverine Weapon X (2009)* #1-5
- "Tomorrow Dies Today" Wolverine Weapon X (2009) #11-15
- Wolverine: Manifest Destiny (2008)
- *"Wolverine Goes to Hell" Wolverine (2010)* #1-16
- Astonishing Spider-Man/Wolverine (2010)
- Death of Wolverine (2014)

> 1 (OP): You are a scholar and a gentleman and I hope a magician one day.
>
> > 3: Honestly, you can read the whole 2003 run of Wolverine, starting with the Greg Rucka run from issues #1-19 and continue to the amazing **Enemy of the State**/Agent of Shield run by the man Mark Millar all the way to Old Man Logan.

3: Wolverine taking on the Hellfire Club in '**the Dark Phoenix Saga**' is great; but also Mark Millar's other Wolverine story '**Enemy of the State**' is good, Wolverine against everyone pretty much

3: I'd say the **Weapon X run in Marvel Comics Presents**.

2: The current Wolverine series All-New Wolverine really is amazing. It's not Logan but Laura is a worthy successor in all the best ways!

1: I recommend Chris Claremont's Wolverine.

Plus, [The 10 best Wolverine comics ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/5ptfo2/the_10_best_wolverine_comics_ever/):

![Death-of-Wolverine-comic-cover-best-wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Death-of-Wolverine-comic-cover-best-wolverine-comics.png)

10. Death of Wolverine
    Wolverine has lost his healing factor. Not even Marvel’s smartest minds can help him. Over the years, Logan has been a warrior, a hero, a renegade, a savage, a samurai, a teacher – and so much more. Logan has spent decades being the best there is at what he does…but even the best fade away eventually. And now, the greatest X-Men hero will play a role he’s never played before. While not a perfect story this is a lean tale by Charles Soule with some amazing artwork by Steve McNiven that could give us some hints on how Logan could die in the upcoming film.

![Wolverine-Madripoor-Nights-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-Madripoor-Nights-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

9. Wolverine Epic Collection: Madripoor Nights
   This massive collection gives us a great Wolverine adventure story. Feeling the urge to cut loose, Wolverine travels to Madripoor, an East Indian island full of pirates, cut-throats and smugglers…just the way Logan likes it! There, he’ll take on ruthless crimelord Roche, meet the cunning Tyger Tiger, wield the mystical Black Blade, battle superhuman enforcers Roughouse and Bloodsport, and contend with drug kingpin Nguyen Ngoc Coy and his niece…the former New Mutant known as Karma! This trade paperback collects one of the most acclaimed runs in Wolverine’s solo series with writers Chris Claremont and Peter David and pencils by John Buscema and Gene Colan.

8. Wolverine: Logan
   In Logan, writer Brian K. Vaughan takes this Wolverine back to Japan to confront old demons from his past. We see a series of flashbacks that expand upon Logan’s time in Japan during WWII. This tale goes a long way towards presenting Wolverine’s life as a piece of human tragedy, rather than a colorful superhero. This series quickly shifts between an intimate character piece and an absurd superhero tale that sees the atomic bomb at Hiroshima dropped on top of Wolverine, but Vaughan manages to balance it all out quite well. While short Vaughan’s deft character development and Eduardo Risso’s heavily inked art make this story stand out.

![Astonishing-X-Men-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Astonishing-X-Men-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

7. Astonishing X-Men
   This is cheating as this is not a stand alone Wolverine story but an X-Men tale. However it’s so well executed and the characterisation of Wolverine so spot on that it needs to be included here. The creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon joins John Cassaday to create a modern Marvel classic. Cyclops and Emma Frost re-form the X-Men with the express purpose of “astonishing” the world. But when breaking news regarding the mutant gene unexpectedly hits the airwaves, will it derail their new plans before they even get started?

![Wolverine-by-Greg-Rucka-Ultimate-Collection-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-by-Greg-Rucka-Ultimate-Collection-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

6. Wolverine by Greg Rucka Ultimate Collection
   Acclaimed novelist and comic writer Greg Rucka’s 19 issue run on Wolverine is a forgotten gem. Joined by artists Darrick Robertson and Leandro Fernandez this trade paperback collects the three volumes of the run. We begin with Wolverine using all of his abilities to deal with some tough human enemies including waitresses, arms dealers, human traffickers, pregnant crime lords, bad dreams and feral female fighters! The second story arc which deals with human trafficking on both sides of the Mexican-American border – delivers on the feral nobility and sense of unflinching justice that really tethers even the most wildly outlandish Wolverine story.

![Wolverine-Enemy-of-the-State-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-Enemy-of-the-State-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

**5. Wolverine: Enemy of the State**
Kick-Ass co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. had a classic 12 issue run on Wolverine that felt like a blockbuster beat-em up movie. Brainwashed by the ninjas of the Hand, Wolverine slices and dices his way through foes and friends alike, ultimately resulting in the death of an X-Man. Captured and reprogrammed, Wolverine is sent against his former masters – but amid an orgy of death and destruction, is even the fiercest mutant alive a match for the deadly stare of the Gorgon. It’s a hard-hitting epic with countless jaw dropping fight scenes, thanks to the symbiotic relationship between Millar’s scripts and John Romita, Jr.’s art.

![Wolverine-Origin-Complete-Collection-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-Origin-Complete-Collection-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

4. Wolverine: Origin
   After decades of fan speculation, Marvel gave readers all of the answers to Wolverine’s complete origin in two best selling miniseries. Long before he became an X-Man, before he was transformed by Weapon X, Wolverine was a boy named James Howlett. But what tragedy could strike that would set him on the path to becoming the ferocious Wolverine? Follow young James from a life of privilege and that fateful first “snikt,” through the devastating events that rip him from his family and ultimately drive him into the wilderness. There, in the snowy wilds of Canada, the feral young man now known as Logan will encounter another mutant very much like him, also torn between man and animal. One who could be his greatest ally – or his fiercest foe. This is a story that fundamentally changed the way people look at Wolverine forever.

3. *Old Man Logan*
   Old Man Logan is on the most satisfying superhero comics of the new century. Revolving around a twisted future where America has been seized and divided up amongst the world’s most powerful super villains, this storyline is a bleak look at a war-torn dystopia that only Wolverine could hope to put an end to. Squaring off against the Red Skull, who has made himself the new President, Wolverine also comes face-to-face with a horde of inbred Hulk monsters, a T-Rex that bonded with the Venom symbiote, and his own haunted past. Mark Millar write a bombastic script and the art by Steve McNiven is stellar. This comic was so successful it looks like Logan the movie is using many of themes and the Old Man Logan character was bought into the current Marvel Universe!

![Wolverine-Weapon-X-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-Weapon-X-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

2. **Wolverine: Weapon X**
   Wolverine’s a lot of things to a lot of people, but to one infamous enclave he was nothing but a… weapon. And weapons kill people. They found that out well enough. Find out just how much “X” can cover in this prequel to recent revelations of the murderous mysteries that have mesmerized our favorite mutant! This is the comic that influenced X-Men Origins: Wolverine the most. With a gut-wrenching script and phenomenal art, Windsor-Smith depicts Wolverine’s startling transformation into a killing machine with the delicate touch of a poet, despite the grim and gory subject matter. 

![Wolverine-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wolverine-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

**1. Wolverine**
The classic and must read tale for any self proclaimed Wolverine fan by comic legends Chris Claremont and Frank Miller in his first solo adventure. For the first time readers got to see much needed depth to the character and shine the spotlight on his personal life more than he could have in a team book. Here, Logan is a man struggling with his feral instincts and animalistic nature. Thanks to this comic Wolverine proved he was a great character on his own and his popularity has only expanded since then.

![X-23-Ultimate-Collection-Volume-1-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190916234255im_/http://bestcomicsever.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/X-23-Ultimate-Collection-Volume-1-comic-cover-best-Wolverine-comics.png)

BONUS: X-23 Ultimate Collection Vol. 1

Wolverine’s daughter X-23 looks like she could be the break out star of the movie. This collection looks at the origin of X-23! Cloned from Wolverine’s cells and raised to be the perfect killer, young Laura Kinney never knew a life free from the harsh masters at The Facility. But now she has broken loose at last, and must forge her own path in the world! Free of her chains and determined to live, Laura will write the next chapter of her story herself. But can X-23 escape her training and her instincts, or will the gallons of blood spilled in her violent past drag her down? A massive trade paperback collection with over 450 pages of X-23 comics!

**Comments on Reddit:**

8: This list doesn't have any *Jason Aaron Wolverine* stories and is therefore worthless.

> 2 (OP): Did think about adding Get Mystique to the list but just missed the top 10. Which Jason Aaron trade would you add to the list?
>
> > 3: Well personally I think Aaron's best Wolverine story is the *Wolverine Goes to Hell* arc in Wolverine (2010) #1-16, which is spread across three trades. I'd definitely put that story, or *Get Mystique*, or *Adamantium Men*, ahead of Madripoor Nights or Astonishing X-Men.

5: Death of Wolverine seems like a stretch. I would characterize it as pretty good, but <u>the art really carries it</u>.

> 1: Totally agree, mcniven can't miss but the story just felt like it jumped from set piece to set piece. The end panel with the sunset was fitting though.

4: Take Mark Millar's Old Man Logan out and stick Lemire's in instead and I'd be a-okay with this list.

> 1 (OP): Is it really that good? I read the Bendis written Vol. 0 and wasn't impressed. Will have to read Lemire's run now!

> 6: Now I am impressed. I don't always agree with all your recommendations, and sometimes think you include some just because they are popular. But the fact you can throw a list like this together, over a property like Aliens, of all things, shows you are very well read across multiple publishers.

3: The three original **Verheiden** series are pretty good. Of the ones that followed, I think *Labyrinth* and *Music of the Spears* were the best, but a lot of of the Aliens comics are surprisingly good.

> 2: Agree, the first three stories are great (**Outbreak**, **Nightmare Asylum** and **Female War**) all three stories are included in the Volume 1 Omnibus, highly recommend.
>
> Omnibus may be the best way to read most of these stories. Finding and collecting single issues for Aliens can be difficult, you just can't find many of them in the wild.

2: **Verheiden** is the OG and the best of the bunch, IMO. Buy the tasty [30th Anniversary edition](https://www.amazon.com/Aliens-30th-Anniversary-Original-Comics/dp/1506700780) of his first arc, Outbreak, and then the also tasty [hardcover collecting his other two stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1506703569/ref=pd_aw_fbt_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B1Z1GQRH28GYH2G5XEET).

I highly recommend those two specific versions mainly because, if you buy other editions, there's no guarantee that they won't be the nasty edited and recolored versions with all the character names changed (the story continues on from the second movie, and was written before Alien3 came out and killed off most of the characters, so Dark Horse rereleased it with the names changed to avoid confusion - never mind that they kept all of their back stories which were identical to the film versions, which was *more* confusing if anything...).

2: I have Green Lantern vs. Aliens and its badass

2: The first run of Aliens in color is amazing. Art by Denis Beauviex.

---

10: You should start with the main three book story arc that essentially started off the Alien comic book franchise. It originally follows Newt and Hicks after the events of the second movie, but the names were altered after the 3rd movie came out. Most of the comics in the Aliens universe are set after the events of these books, so some things might not make sense if you haven't read them. Also, the original Aliens vs Predator comics are absolutely one of my favorite comics.

**Aliens: Outbreak**

**Aliens: Nightmare Asylum**

**Aliens: Female War**

*Alien vs. Predator*

edit: spelling

6: Aliens 30th Anniversary: The Original Comic Series
Aliens: The Original Comic Series - **Nightmare Asylum** and Earth War
*Aliens: Defiance*
Aliens: Dead Orbit

> 4: Here is the right answer

3: There's a really cool one in the Judge Dredd universe as well, where a hive is located in the under-ruins of MC-1. Otherwise, there's a few Omnibus collections of the old 90s comic books that collect every issue made back then. Same with Predator too, both published by Dark Horse. You can find those decently cheap too online

2: You're going to get all sorts of answers. My recommendation is the Fire and Stone series followed by the Life and Death series. These series take place before and after the Prometheus timeline, extends through the Alien and Aliens franchise, and I think they add to the lore of the movies.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Stone) is a link to wikipedia because I can't access comic sites at work.

Have fun!

2: Aliens: Countdown

Part 1: http://www.comicextra.com/aliens-countdown/chapter-1/full

Part 2: http://www.comicextra.com/aliens-countdown/chapter-2/full

A cool little short Aliens comic with excellent artwork. Just scroll down a little past the silly ads to get to the comic book parts.

1: Lots of great suggestions so far, you really can't go wrong where ever you start.

Aliens: Salvation is my personal favourite, I believe it's part of the omnibus vol 3.

It's drawn by Mike Mignola(Hellboy) and his art style really translates well to the IP. The story is very good too!

Have fun, I really wish I could read them all again with a fresh start! I envy your journey!

### Blade Runner

Among the comics on Blader Runner official is only [Blade Runner 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45033606-blade-runner-2019-vol-1?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4ZNCpNkBS0&rank=1) and it is good.

### Doctor Who

**I wanna start reading doctor who comics But I don't know where should I start I mean what's the right order of the comics And where can I find it?** 

Answer (by [LegoK9](https://www.reddit.com/user/LegoK9/)):

> I mean what's the right order of the comics

There are like, a dozen or so Doctor Who comic series by half a dozen publishers.

The most recommended are [Doctor Who Magazine](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine_graphic_novels) and [Titan Comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/85stpi/titan_comics_doctor_who_series_miniseries_and).

Just pick a Doctor you like and start at the beginning of (one of) their runs.

---

3 (LegoK9): *The Weeping Angels of Mons*

2: I’ve only read a few but I really liked the Star Trek Next Generation crossover. Has there been any other Doctor Who crossovers?

2: My favorite is [Abslom Daak](https://i.imgur.com/U90NSRH.jpg), but it may be hard to find a copy now, unfortunately.

2: As [/u/LegoK9](https://www.reddit.com/u/LegoK9/) says, Titan's Tenth Doctor tale *The Weeping Angels of Mons* is almost certainly the best short arc that they have produced so far - and is available as a graphic novel.

Other than that, both *Year One* and *Year Two* of their *Eleventh Doctor* run (volume 1 - 6, I think) are extremely good - and work best (especially Year Two) read as a straight run through - single issues will just be confusing.

Their Third Doctor mini-series *The Heralds of Destruction* is also great fun, and the Ninth Doctor mini-series *Weapons of Past Destruction* is also very true to this team's TV appearances.

Looking back to IDW, before them, both *Prisoners of Time* and *The Forgotten* are enjoyable.

Then there are the Panini comics from Doctor Who Magazine - where the entire Eighth Doctor run is a very good one. These are collected into four volumes: *Endgame*, *The Glorious Dead*,*Oblivion* and *The Flood*. I'm not sure about the availability of all of these - I think that *The Flood* was out of print at one point - but may be found on ebay etc.

> All of the Panini graphic novels are still in print.
>
> They can still be purchased directly from Amazon and Book Depository.

12: There have been loads over the years.

At the moment, **Titan** have the license for actual comics and are producing some excellent material in general:

- The Eleventh Doctor - *the first two years* of this have been brilliant - arguably better than S6 and 7 on TV, and I'd recommend them to anyone. We are now into the third year, which isn't quite on the same level, but is still interesting.
- The Twelfth Doctor - had some great arcs in *Year One*, and hit a real high point in the first half of *Year Two*. Has been a little more patchy since, but still generally very good - and the current arc is looking excellent.
- The Tenth Doctor - The highpoint so far is the *Weeping Angels of Mons* arc - outstanding, and probably best use of the Angels since *Blink*. Otherwise, the tales have been above average and pretty enjoyable overall.
- The Ninth Doctor - started with an excellent miniseries, which really caught the spirit and characterization of all the characters involved. Then became an ongoing series and has been generally good, but perhaps the most patchy of their ongoing series overall.
- Torchwood - more style than substance, and fairly slow moving as a result. Interesting, but not outstanding.

They have also done a number of miniseries for some of the Doctors - *The Eight Doctor* was a bit wishy-washy, *The Fourth Doctor* was very well characterized, but a mediocre plot, and the *Third Doctor* was brilliant.

And then there are their 'event' series, which have been mediocre at best, and gernally disappointing.

Besides **Titan**, the other line that is still ongoing is the comic strip in **Doctor Who Magazine**, which is giving us some great material for the *Twelfth Doctor* overall, but probably peaked with it's long *Eighth Doctor run* - collected into TPB's which can be difficult to find, but are worth it.

Historically the early comic strips for the first two Doctors - published in the Polystyle group of comics/magazines are really only curiosities for completists, but some of the later Third Doctor strips are really quite excellent in artwork and plot, and can rival the TV tales of the time. However the Fourth Doctor tales rapidly went downhill again, until they moved to DWM.

Prior to Titan, IDW had the licence for comics and produced a few good miniseries such as *The Forgotten* and *Prisoners of Time* which are well worth hunting out, but otherwise did not hit the same league as the current Titan tales.

> 3: Without giving it away, I do like how 10 worked out how to beat the Angels. I did like 11's story arc with Daak.

5: Yes.

The question is....which ones though?

Personally I would recommend the panini graphic novel collections. The **doctor who magazine** comic strip is for me the best doctor who comic form which all other series hope to live up to. And they have a natural advantage- a much closer connection to the BBC, and by being one part of a magazine, the comic doesn't need to always e trying any gimmicks to bring people in, it's enough that it's enjoyable.

Recommended reading- 5th doctor, *tides of time*, 6th doctor *voyager* and *the world shapers*, *all the eighth doctor* strips, tenth doctor *Crimson hand*, and *all the eleventh doctor* books.

These are the arcs where the comic really came into its own, deciding to create their own story arcs without focusing on what is happening in the tv series, or in other words, leading with great stories, instead of trying to follow what others are doing.

As for the other series, IDW is all right, but never really grabbed me (seemed to have too much continuity references for their own sake- I remember one author trying to make his story appealing by finally having the fifth doctor meet the juddoon) and **Titan** seems to be having the same issues, particularly with their multi doctor events. I really enjoy the *weeping angel of mons* (tenth doctor series) as it made me realize how we never saw the angels again in the same way we did in blink (when they returned with the eleventh doctor they were the mad killers, not those who killed with kindness by sending people back), and subsequently we had not seen the doctor face those angels directly. Also like the fourth doctor series, eyes of the medusa, as it seemed a good attempt to show the sort f story the fourth doctor would have had in television, whereas the third doctor series was clearly the sort of story a fan would write occurring between the series but would have never had appeared on television.

3: Well, *The World-Shapers* was directly referenced twice in *World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls.* It was also written by Grant Morrison.

Colin Baker even wrote a graphic novel himself. For the **DW Magazine** comics, I don't know how many of them are considered worth the time/money, but as an artifact of the series' past and something more permanent to fans from that era than the TV show was (VHS copies of the episodes didn't start coming out til 1983 and came out 1-5 per year til after the show was cancelled), I'd say they're worth a look.

2: I've not read many but those I have read have been generally very good, although aimed more at hardcore fans than casual viewers, as they often feature and expand on sub plots and tertiary characters from the tv series. I just finished reading the 12 issue series "*Prisoners of time*", which was released for the 50th anniversary and I have to say, as a fan of both classic and new who, it was excellent and I would highly recommend.

1: The Titan miniseries (*3*,*4* and *8*) are good, *11th Doc* is consistently good, 10th is eh with a few good arcs here and there and I can't speak for 9 or 12. The IDW comics can be hit or miss. For sure I'd recommend Titan's *11th Doctor*.

---

5: I'm not really a fan of **IDW**'s Tenth Doctor comics. I prefer **Titan**'s and **Doctor Who Magazine**'s a lot more. I think it's mostly to do with the art style for me, though I'm also a big fan of the other comic lines' stories.

You have a few options for Tenth Doctor comics

- DWM: The Betrothal of Sontar - 10/Rose
- IDW: Doctor Who (2008) - 10/Martha
- DWM: The Widow's Curse - 10/Martha & 10/Donna
- DWM: *The Crimson Hand* - 10/Majenta
- Titan: The Tenth Doctor - 10/Gabby/Cindy
- IDW: Doctor Who (2009) - 10/Emily/Matthew

I loved his later two DWM graphic novels, and his current run with Titan Comics is pretty great as well.

---

8: In modern day, there's basically three big groups of comic publishers: **IDW**, **Panini**, and **Titan**. You can get an overview of each from [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_comic_stories).

**IDW** no longer does Doctor Who comics, but they had a Tenth and Eleventh Doctor series, as well as several special stories. You can find more information [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/IDW_Publishing).

Panini is the company publishing the comics featured in **DWM**. [There was a fantastic comment on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/5lqgcl/big_finish_doom_coalition_4_trailer/dc0apsj/) that gives you all the info you would need about them, and how they're organized.

**Titan** also currently publishes their own comics, featuring Doctor Who. They currently publish Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Doctor comics, and have published Third, Fourth, and Eighth Doctor comics in the past. These are ongoing series, and are currently being published as I type. Additionally, Titan has published several other comics, including Torchwood comics, Ghost Stories (featuring the Ghost from *The Return of Doctor Mysterio*) and Summer Special comic events. You can find more information [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Titan_Publishing_Group).

Personally, the Titan stuff is fairly easy to find and digest, and is split up pretty well. The Panini stuff has some great artwork, but it can be a bit dense, and it's more expensive than the Titan stuff, generally. If you're looking for a good place to start, try starting with Titan, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

> 2: I highly recommend the *Eleventh Doctor's run* at Titan. I haven't kept up but the first 4 or 5 volumes were great! The art work is... not everyone's cup of tea but I don't mind because it fit sand flows and the story is interesting.
>
> They're all good, different from one another, but just wanted to give a heads up on 11's art styling, which I've heard complaints on.
>
> 2: On top of above suggestions, give *The Weeping Angels of Mons* a read. It's a fantastic Weeping Angel story in the 10th Doctor's run.

2: The best comics are the **DWM** ones. The entire *8th doctor run* is a must read along with *Voyager*, Tides of Time and all the 4th doctor ones.

2: The first comic to get me into Doctor Who comics was "Doctor Who Classics" and I still haven't read much more. Iron Legion is just gripping and goofy and perfect 4th.

---

7: Long post sorry but tried to make this as comprehensive as I could for the different publishers and what to expect from each:

**Doctor Who Magazine Comics**

The longest running of Doctor Who comics and probably the most consistent of the major publishers. Forming a single series across the Doctors, it does build its own lore over the years but has plenty of jumping on points and you can start with any Doctor you want, I'll list the major jumping on points though. All of the TPBs are still in print and are easy to get ahold of at a decent price.

*The beginning* - Starting at the start with Tom Baker's first volume isn't a bad choice. You have some very good early strips by acclaimed 2000AD writers and they really capture Tom Baker's Doctor in a way I feel a lot of more recent 4th Doctor stories don't quite.

*Steve Parkhouse's run* - Parkhouse was one of the longest serving DWM writers and a very good comic writer in general. Starting with the 4th Doctor strip "The Deal", collected in the second 4th Doctor volume, Parkhouse builds a run across the 4th, 5th and 6th Doctor that's accessible enough to jump on board with any Doctor but more narratively satisfying to follow from the start as he builds on his own lore and narrative themes across his run. Parkhouse's run is among the most held up Doctor Who comics and both Tides of Time and Voyager are 2 of the highest rates stories by fans.

*post-Parkhouse* - Parkhouse leaves half way through the 6th Doctor's first collected volume and the writing keeps rotating between different creators through the 6th and 7th Doctors eras. The 6th Doctor still has a few stand outs in this time following on from Parkhouse, The World Shapers story by Grant Morrison in particular is very popular and was explicitly referenced in the s10 finale. But DWM lose their way a bit in early 7th Doctor stories. They're not bad stories, just a bit directionless and tonally light. After a few years though DWM editorial themselves feel they could be doing more and work hard to use their stable of varied writers to their strength and try to build a varied series of stories that for the first time reflect the show and move between light and heavy stories. Jumping ahead to the v2 or v3 for the 7th Doctor isn't a bad idea if you're not as willing to sit through a lot of light hearted strips that never really build up much momentum. As of v5 the 7th Doctor comics do start to use book companion Benny but the stories are still accessible enough not knowing her (and if you want her introduction you can stand alone read Love and War or listen to the BF adaptation and it's a great story).

*8th Doctor's run* - It's debatable whether this or Parkhouse's run is the more iconic of the DWM runs. Great series of stories that builds its own ongoing story for the 8th Doctor, definitely start at the start with v1 for the most rewarding experience. Writing was shared between Alan Barnes and Scott Gray early on before Scott Gray becomes the single writer for the series. Alan Barnes stories are strong, but Gray's are the highlight and I confess Barnes' characterisation for companion Izzy never really worked for me but she grew on me in leaps and bounds once Gray really took over. These stories were also a huge influence on the new show, RTD was a big fan and he lifted more than one idea for his era of the show. Most nuWho finales in RTD's time as showrunner are influenced by this run to varying levels.

*nuWho Doctors* - DWM had a lot of creative freedom even before the wilderness years, there was never much pressure or rules placed on them to be like the show and they never really were because of that. With the return of the show though DWM had to get much more in line with whatever was on TV, so more than any other era nuWho Doctors are the most accessible of DWM's comics. I'm only part way through the 10th Doctor's run so I can't speak with much insight but there are some cool stories in here, some of which became the basis of TV stories, and although he stepped away for a few years into the role of just editing the comic Scott Gray has come back to do some very well received stories for the 11th and 12th Doctors.

**IDW Comics**

IDW opened the license with a couple of years of mini-series and one shots for the 10th Doctor, the only one of which I'd significantly recommend is The Whispering Gallery one-shot.

After initial success they launched a Doctor Who ongoing starring the 10th Doctor, it's very continuity heavy pulling tonnes of classic and even Big Finish references making itself difficult for more casual fans and not particularly good either.

IDW opened the 11th Doctor's era with a relaunch from issue #1, this new ongoing was the same writer that had handled the 10th Doctor's run, but his writing is much improved, towards the end of v2 the writer changes which also gives a boost in quality.

IDW had a second relaunch during the 11th Doctor's era and v3 is probably the strongest ongoing IDW did with the license.

IDW also put out a few mini-series during the 11th Doctor's run. Most memorable an 11th Doctor Star Trek TNG crossover and the 50th anniversary *Prisoners of Time* with a single issue for each Doctor, in both cases YMMV.

Overall while IDW have their moments, and their 11th Doctor run was consistently enjoyable, they have the weakest output with the license of the 3 significant publishers. Titan collected all the IDW stuff except the Star Trek crossover into 3 trades called Archives if you want to give a look though, I recommend jumping straight to the 11th Doctor stuff if you do.

**Titan Comics**

Titan are the biggest mixed bag of the publishers and they also flood the market compared to the others so they can be a bit more overwhelming. I'll break them down by Doctor.

*Classic Doctor Mini-Series* - So far there's been tree mini series for classic Doctors, the easy stand out for most being Paul Cornell's Third Doctor mini series that tells an engaging story of its own while being a hugely nostalgic era celebration of the *3rd Doctor* and Cornell's writing farewell to Doctor Who (before he backpedaled slightly tempted back by the new Target books). There's also the 4th and 8th Doctor mini-series, neither is stand out in the way the *3rd Doctor's mini-series* but both decent reads. I personally enjoy the 8th Doctor's more of the two.

*9th Doctor Series* - Comprised of a mini-series followed by a single ongoing, got off to a decent start but never really has much in the way of stand out stories and I find I liked it less as it went on and it didn't seem to capture anyone as their favourite.

*10th Doctor Series* - 3 ongoing series separated into "Years" that operate like separate seasons of the show. Builds a new journey for the 10th Doctor with a new set of companions set during his specials year. The stories are a bit hit and miss but rarely bad and it does very good long running character work across the run with good companion growth and engaging characters. The "season finale" type stories do tend to be a bit messy and dense, I find them usually the weakest part of the 10th Doctor stuff so don't be too put off if you have fun but don't like a finale, it's worth carrying on if you've enjoyed it up to then.

*11th Doctor Series* - The easy stand out of Titans output IMO. Similar to the 10th Doctor, split into "Years" each like its own season and builds its own era with new companions set between s5 and s6. *11th Doctor* stuff isn't just good Doctor Who stories but genuinely good comics in general. Some of the biggest current talent in comics worked on this and put out some really experimental and impressive stories. Strong characterisation of the Doctor and original companions, strong stories some of which really experiment with the comic medium and really adds to the shows lore in a way I feel genuinely adds to what we saw on screen with the 11th Doctor.

*12th Doctor Series* - The most inconsistent of Titan's output, most likely in part down to a lack of freedom and writers lack of familiarity with the era having to write for it as it's unfolding. Follows a "Year" format once again, but the splitting points feel a bit more arbitrary since it's always structured around changes in the show that don't line up with the relaunches. At its best it's better than the 9th Doctor series, at its worst it's Titans worst output. I'd advise skipping to Year Two if you want to give it a go and I feel Year Two and Three are mostly fun engaging stories but it does have a weak showing at the end when a new writer comes on board at the same time Bill does.

*Yearly Multi-Doctor Events* - These are of very variable quality, none of them are great but to different degrees they can be fun very fannish reads depending on if that's your thing. They use original Titan companions travelling with the Doctors but each Doctor ongoing is totally stand alone from these so they're a totally optional read and not reflective of Titan's usual quality.

Titan are also building up to a new direction to coincide with Whittaker's era. The 10th and 11th Doctors are getting fresh ongoings with totally new directions and a new 13th Doctor ongoing with one of Titan's best artists and a new writer. There's also the recently announced "Road to the Thirteenth Doctor" one shots for Doctors 10, 11 and 12 that'll lead up to Whittaker's debut, but I'm cautious about them as they're all written by the worst writer Titan have.

5: If you're a New Series fan, check out Titan's stuff. The *Tenth Doctor* and *Eleventh Doctor* stuff is generally really strong, and the Ninth and Twelfth Doctor stuff have their moments. They're a bit easier to get into, and while artwork can sometimes be wonky as hell (I don't think anyone has been able to do a good Eleventh Doctor from what I've read so far), the stories are mostly good.

If you're interested in the Classic Series, Panini (the publishers of Doctor Who Magazine) have been collecting old comics into graphic novels. These feature the Fourth Doctor on, and have work by some pretty big people (Dave Gibbons, the artist for Watchmen, did the artwork for most of the Fourth Doctor's run and the first story of Five's run, Andrew Cartmel wrote for Seven, and Rob Shearman wrote for Nine). Those comica are generally really high quality, with generally great artwork and strong stories. They're a bit more mature than Titan's stuff (not a dig at all), and as such, they can be a bit heavy, so be aware of that.

There's a lot of earlier comics, but those are harder to come by, and there's also IDW, who did some Ten and Eleven comics in the late 2000s and early 2010s, but I'm not as familiar with those, honestly, so I can't in good conscience make a recommendation there either way.

5 (by LegoK9): The current run of Doctor Who comics by Titan comics are high quality and very accessible for modern fans. I highly recommend *The Weeping Angels of Mons*.

Titan has main series for Doctors 9-12 and miniseries for 3, 4, and 8. A series for 13 and a miniseries for 7 come out this year.

There are also three multi-Doctor crossover stories.

[Here's my visual guide for how the crossovers fit in each Doctor's timeline,](https://i.imgur.com/DLGJVaz.jpg) but they aren't essential reading for the main plots.

2: Titan. They're like new who done in the serial format of old who. They expand the source material in various ways, and they have a ninth doctor mini.

1: if you like *The Sandman*, then track down Steve Parkhouse's early '80's work. they have some stylistic similarities to that period Gaiman.

> Or where is a good place to start for someone who hasn't gotten into the Who universe beyond the show?

as with the television series, you really do not have to know anything. you already know the basics.

### Godzilla

> Best Godzilla comic book runs?

5: Try out *Half-Century War*! Definitely one of my faves :D

> 3: Yup. This is the only one worth the hardcover. It's an encapsulated story - beginning, middle and, importantly, an end. The art by James Stokoe is jaw dropping and as detailed as Jeff Darrow. In all the best book ever.
>
> https://orcstain.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/skreeonk.jpg

3: *Half century war* and rulers of the earth (if only for Matt Frank's wonderful art)

> 1: Matt Frank is crazy good at art.

3: Others have mentioned *Rulers of the Earth* (which is connected to some other IDW Godzilla runs of varying quality and references them), but I want to make a mention of the Marvel run, if only because it ends with him fighting the Avengers.

---

> Where to start with Godzilla comics

4: As far as im aware there are 3 different universes based on publisher, you have the original **Marvel** Godzilla comics, which has the much more dinosaurian mean green look, intermingles with other marvel heroes on a constant basis. If you like that sort of thing and vintage comics go with that.

Then there's the **Dark Horse** comics but I don't know much about those.

**IDW** is the newest and probably the best from a fan standpoint. There are three main runs of comics here that is one continuity), Kingdom of Monsters (first) Godzilla (second) and *Rulers of Earth* (third and final) while kingdom of monsters is kind of garbage, Godzilla is good and Rulers of earth is FANTASTIC, highly recommend it. you can skip Kingdom if you want.

> 3: Then there are the ones that stand completely on their own: Godzilla in Hell Cataclysm The Half-Century War Gangsters and Goliaths
>
> You could skip these if you want, but they're great little graphic novels you could usually take out in one sitting. I highly recommend Cataclysm and The *Half-Century War*.

1: I started with *Half Century War* but moved on to *Rulers of Earth* which I highly recommend.

1: Super short and easy to collect (5 issues) is Godzilla in Hell. It's super weird but I absolutely fucking love it. It's my favorite comic serial ever. It's very very abstract though.

1: I used to have the Essential Marvel omnibus of their Godzilla run from '77-'79, but sold it a few years ago to a friend. It's reasonably entertaining in a '70s comics kinda way, and I love to see my favorite kaiju clashing with many of the Marvel characters I grew up reading (Godzilla clashes with the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in the final story arc).

I grew up on the Dark Horse Godzilla series back in the mid-90s, and this run features a lot of the work of Art Adams, my favorite Western Godzilla artist ever. Dark Horse began their association with Godzilla back in '88 when they released a translation of Kazuhisa Iwata's manga adaptation of The Return of Godzilla, and they released the very good *Godzilla Color Special* in '92, featuring Godzilla battling Gekido-jin (an homage to Daiei's Daimajin) and some stellar art from Mr. Adams. While they weren't able to secure or afford the rights to other Toho kaiju, the writers came up with some fairly interesting foes for Godzilla, and even had a race of hunter aliens (a riff on Predator?) attempting to bag Godzilla like a big-game trophy, only to find him to be the most dangerous game. Though very '90s, it's quite an entertaining run, worth checking out.

Most fans these days are into IDW's ongoing main series and miniseries. This run got off to a rocky start, and it ranges from the mediocre (G:Kingdom of Monsters) to the superb (*Godzilla: the Half-Century War* and G:Legends). Still, like the Dark Horse run, it's well worth your time. Any time spent with the Big G is time well-spent, no matter what media it is.

**EDIT:** Forgot to mention Legendary's prequel comic, Godzilla: Awakening, released just weeks before the movie back in spring '14. I don't remember much about this one, except that it was a bland bit of promotional product for the movie, and its art was pretty weak overall. Too bad, as I was looking forward to seeing Godzilla and Dr. Ishiro Serizawa's respective misadventures in the decades before the events of G'14.

> The IDW Godzilla comics, has anyone read them?

5: IMO:

Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters - Very "meh". Some cool monster moments, but the human stuff is mostly forgettable. Serves as set up for Ongoing and Rulers of Earth, but you could honestly skip it.

Gangsters and Goliaths - I think this one is really good. Nice contained story with decent human characters that actually get some attention, an interesting plot and some solid monster action.

Godzilla (Ongoing) - Pretty cool. Much better than Kingdom with better human work, more monsters and bigger battles. I'd say start here if you want to read it and Rulers.

Godzilla Legends - These range from decent to awesome. Five separate stories, so you could pick and choose.

*Godzilla: Rulers of Earth* - This is top notch. Better human focus, bigger monster brawls and even more kaiju throughout.

*Godzilla: The Half-Century War* - This is my personal favourite. A five issue story that tells a very interesting human story set alongside some cool kaiju action.

*Godzilla: Cataclysm* - I love this one due to the setting and the world they set up. Solid monster showcase and fairly good human characters as well.

Godzilla in Hell - Really cool art and an interesting, and humanless, story.

Godzilla: Oblivion - Pretty solid, IMO. A pretty interesting plot and some cool monster action.

Godzilla: Rage Across Time - Much like Legends, the stories range in quality.

Of you're looking for a Top 3 that are worth checking out I'd recommend *Rulers*, *Half-Century War* and *Cataclysm*. But Ongoing/Gangsters/Oblivion/Hell are solid enough as well.

3: Definitely *Cataclysm*, *Rulers of Earth* and *Half Century War*. Solid reads. *Rulers of Earth* is epic. Also, Godzilla In Hell. Haven’t read Rage Across Time yet but I heard good things.

3: I loved Legends and Godzilla in Hell. *Half Century War* was alright. Never really got too into the others. The art is solid in all of them that I've came across though.

2: I've read:

Kingdom of Monsters - Awful, but has a few decent issues.

Gangsters and Goliaths - Pretty good overall, but the art is weak.

Godzilla Ongoing - Decent writing, decent art, worth a read.

Legends - Mediocre mixed bag. Totally skippable, IMO.

*Half-Century War* - Very good, with excellent artwork and a solid story.

*Cataclysm* - My personal favorite Godzilla comic. Everything just gels perfectly together, and I wish to God that this was a longer series.

Godzilla In Hell - My second favorite Godzilla comic ever. The only truly weak issue, IMO, is Bob Eggleton's (unpopular opinion, I know), but the art is great and the writing is creative.

2: *Rulers of Earth* is definitely my personal favourite. Interesting plot (for Godzilla, anyway), likeable humans, and of course, great kaiju battles that even use some old, old kaiju. Varn, Zilla, and Geozora come to mind. In fact, the only kaiju I think don't fight are Hedorah and Gabara. Definitely worth a read, but one of the volumes (the fourth?) is extremely rare, so you'll have to read it another way.

---

3: *Half Century War* and *Rulers of Earth* are easily the best in my opinion. HCW is a standalone mini series so you can jump right in, RoE is a follow up to Kingdom of Monsters and Godzilla(History's Greatest Monster), but those aren't exactly stellar and you don't miss a whole lot by skipping them.

---

5: *Half century war* is general consider to be the best.

> 1: Gotta agree, first comic I ever read.

3: *Half Century War* is great, but my favorite has to be Gangsters and Goliaths. It's more of a Mothra story than a Godzilla story, but it's still fantastic. I really like the balance of human and kaiju drama, and it's a really great use of the Mothra mythos.

2: Godzilla vs. Barkley.

> Me: is this a joke? :D

Also, the old Marvel Godzilla is great fun but will probably never be reprinted due to licencing issues.

---

17: [*Godzilla: Half Century War*](https://www.amazon.com/Godzilla-Half-Century-War-IDW/dp/1613775954) is one of the best Godzilla comics ever made, imo. It's definitely worth checking out even if you're not a Godzilla fan, if only for James Stokoe's [awesome art](http://i.imgur.com/mWc0Z.jpg).

Collectors, the IDW hardcover edition is Absolute-sized and super nice.

> 1: His Kaiju are just amazing. They really give off this sense of size and weight that you'd expect them to have.
>
> This is the first time where I've seen Godzilla and really felt like he was this unstoppable force of nature.

5: [Godzilla vs. Barkley](https://d2lzb5v10mb0lj.cloudfront.net/covers/300/g/gvb.jpg) is a must

> Me: is this a joke? :D

3: Godzilla In Hell was entertaining.

2: *Half Century War* by James Stokoe is absolutely godlike.

---

3: *Godzilla: Cataclysm* is a great mini series. Also *Godzilla: Rulers of Earth*, Godzilla In Hell and Godzilla Rage Across Time. If you are into older comics, Darkhorse had a 90’s series that ran for around 15 issues or so called simply Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I believe. That one was pretty solid but mostly nostalgic for me.

> 2 : You may be able to find some on Amazon but some may have to be purchased through third party sellers which are fulfilled through Amazon. If you want complete collections of lots and such, you can search eBay. Also try sites like Entertainment Earth or Things From Another World.

---

3: I'd say *half century war* is the best, it stays most true to classic portrayals of the monsters, I think.

2: *Rulers of Earth* is far and away the best series they produced. It's a follow up to the vastly inferior *Rulers of Earth* and History's Greatest Monster, but it's not really necessary to read those first. I'd recommend diving right into Rulers of Earth and going back and re reading the first two series if you want to afterwards.

> Idk, I always felt *Rulers of Earth*'s dialogue was a little weak compared to *Cataclysm* or *Half-Century War*
>
> Everything else was great.

1: Legends is great. Godzilla in Hell is pretty cool and the art is good but there's not much narrative.

### Judge Dredd

16: Dredd is unfortunately even worse than Marvel and DC because he's got one unbroken continuity for 30some years, over 2100 "progs" (issues, I believe usually 6 pages every week), he ages in real time, and constantly references events that happened decades ago. In recent issues he's still dealing with fallout from the Apocalypse War, which happened in the 80s.

If you really want to just get right into it, I would suggest buying the *Complete Case Files #1* and going from there. I'd love to pick up all those Mega Collection books but I can only image how expensive that'd be here in Canada. If you're from the UK, and you can find them for a decent price, have at it.

I think basically the best advice with ANY character is just jump in wherever you want, and know that you might have to look a few things up. As people have mentioned, Apocalypse War and the Cursed Earth Saga are great old runs (with the Apocalypse War being a constant major theme throughout his entire history), *Origins* and *America* are excellent "middle years" stories, and the three Day of Chaos books and Titan are good modern day stories. Understand that early Dredd is very silly, but it's a sci-fi comic, so that's expected. It becomes a little more "grounded" later on, as much as it can/should, but you'll find that most of the case files books or other collections do a good job of having contained stories that can be enjoyed on their own.

8: Been re-reading the entirety of Dredd over the past few years as well as his spin-offs. I'd say you should go for the mega collection and start off with the following handful of books from it:

*Origins*

*America*

Brothers of the blood

The apocalypse war

Judge Death lives

The cursed earth

Psi-judge Anderson: The possessed

These books are really the foundation of Dredd. *Origins* and Brothers of the blood pretty much sum up his backstory as well as handling the world-building while *America* goes into how the citizens view the judges. They're great individually as introductory Dredd books because they just need you to understand the idea that the judges are dictators and the citizens both hate and need them and they each have great stories. Reading these will allow you to read most of the stuff in the mega collection as most of the books are filled with standalone stories built around a theme like there's one all about assassins and another about horror monsters.

If you enjoy those 3 then Apocalypse war, Judge Death lives and the cursed earth are a great next step. They all expand Dredd's world, introduce major characters that'll be important for big events set after them and they're pretty solid standalone reads.

The Anderson book collects her first handful of solo stories. There's some amazing work here with great writing and some of the best art I've seen from comics but the main reason to read this after the others I mentioned is that she plays big roles in a lot of major stories like Necropolis and Judgement on Gotham set later on so it's worth knowing the character a bit.

Dredd can seem like an intimidating comic series to get into because of how long it's been running but all you really need to get into any of his books is a Wikipedia summary of what the franchise is about. After that he's pretty simple.

<u>I'd say avoid the case files</u>. I've tried reading them and they're just not as enjoyable to read due to the production quality. The paper in the mega collection feels so much better than the old newspaper stuff in the case files, the binding is better since the pages are sewn to the spine in the same way as a marvel omnibus which just makes it so comfy to read compared to the files where they're glued into the spine. Lastly, and maybe it's not really an advantage depending on opinion but Dredd hasn't always put out winners and the case files start from issue 1 and go through everything so you have to deal with filler and straight-up bad stories while <u>the collection tends to leave the really bad and irrelevant stuff out</u>.

Good luck getting into the character, hope you enjoy him since I always want to see more Dredd fans. Feel free to shoot me a message if you want to ask any further questions.

6: *Case Files 5* is a good starting point. Contains *Blockmania* and *The Apocalypse War*.

For modern Dredd, id go for *America*, *Origins* or Mandroid.

Edit: or Titan. Titan was great!

4: The Complete Case Files are perfect. If you don't want to start at #1 I'd go with *#5*. This contains *Blockmania* and *The Apocalypse War* which are the perfect go to at any point in Dredds history.

2: Agreed on *Case Files vol. 5*, and on "*America*"--both stone classics.

I also really love "Trifecta," which does a lot less hand-holding up front--you'll probably be baffled at first if you're going in cold--but is eventually pretty clear, and is also a fantastic story.

1: STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING IDW HAS DONE WITH DREDD. It's all completely awful, trust me. Keep it to 2000AD.

Start with Case Files #1 and go from there.

---

10: Here's a video for ya mate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yUwX1rR-zc

> *Case Files vol. 1*, *Case Files vol. 5*, *America*.

5: I just started recently myself and after looking into a bit it seemed like the recommendations were either to start at the beginning if you're a completionist or jump to *complete case files 05* that has a few iconic stories. I picked up *complete case files 05* and am enjoying it so far but I still have a ways to go with it. So far none of it really felt like I jumped into a story halfway through. Other recommendations were either *America* or *Origins* but I haven't read them yet so hopefully someone else can weigh in.

Most of the stories I've read seem to be stand alone cases though, sort of like a police procedural like law & order except the stories take place in a sci-fi future and the police, lawyers, and judges are all rolled up into completely over the top fascist super cops. 

> 9: *Case Files 05* has *Block Mania*, *The Apocalypse War* and The Dark Judges in it. it's an absolutely brilliant introduction to the character and features some of the most iconic early stories.
>
> *America* is fantastic and one of the best Dredd stories ever written, but it definitely doesn't paint Dredd and the whole Judges system in a very good light.

2: [*Judge Dredd: America*](http://www.amazon.com/Judge-Dredd-America-John-Wagner/dp/1781083703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439796591&sr=8-1&keywords=judge+dredd+america) is often considered the best Judge Dredd story, and it just got reprinted in trade paperback!

---

I get asked "where do I start with *Judge Dredd*?" rather a lot. My short answer: Of the books that are currently in print in the U.S., **you're going to want to start** with [*Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files 05*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781080283/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1781080283). That's right: volume 5. It's a very solid introduction; you won't need any information from the earlier volumes that it won't give you, and you can always go back and read those volumes later if you want. It's a big fat black-and-white paperback with a year's worth of weekly stories, circa 1981-1982, including (among others) three very fondly remembered serials: "Judge Death Lives" (drawn by Brian Bolland), "Block Mania" and "The Apocalypse War" (drawn by Dredd's co-creator Carlos Ezquerra).

The **best introduction** to *Judge Dredd* is probably *America*, a collection of three stories by John Wagner and Colin MacNeil (from 1990, 1996 and 2006) that made the series much more interestingly complicated. It's finally back in print--in the U.K., not the U.S.--but there's [a Kindle edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905437587/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1905437587&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20) of it that's available in the U.S., too. (There's also an argument that a lot of the drama of *America* comes from its reversal of what had come before it; I still think it's a terrific place to start.)

The **most recent material that's been collected** is [Judge Dredd: Tour of Duty - Mega-City Justice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907992391/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1907992391)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/MR47EhB5RE0Aif-KjwDTlxHTKG_QP8D84XNJEakZN1PVGOGcIPsdJF5Q2PqzUhLMIS50IYKhgGB6KKFmnprvM8Ly7NmgDBFWi9vOyTj02TEmmOtNiHXqmMw=s0-d) , which collects a pretty terrific 2009-2010 serial. It's a British book, though, and effectively the second half of a long storyline (the first half has been collected as [Judge Dredd: Tour of Duty - The Backlash](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907519238/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1907519238)![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/EJaB25eqApk62yFERfGNPqT6r8rP4f0PCibwSY7VSn8AJB1eA3P5bTx4ee_1QywD9_YXgCa0fFpU1b4H7r6VKip410MFGO34r1bKmAcjBXCQpgJdIOlnO1I=s0-d)). (UPDATE: As of this writing, the most recent U.K. material to be collected is the terrific [Judge Dredd: Trifecta](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQBW&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RRCyWsL8tTF4Wy3VGYjL2nwMFUxGaxCCJZ0WXihosypGPVRvpFXkgphQsrWzrnr-G_fVW7l2W8DZ0pUQCJZqy-aTihmnnw0V6oP-46Yl6xk08Y2iGAYNrjV97k6K0A=s0-d).)

The **most recent long storyline** in the weekly *2000 AD* comics was "Day of Chaos," an excellent, very densely packed thriller that ran for an entire year, from *2000 AD* #1740 to 1789. It hasn't yet been collected, and it's the payoff for several years' worth of buildup. You can, however, buy the whole thing issue-by-issue, in physical or digital form, from [2000 AD's site](http://shop.2000adonline.com/). (UPDATE: It's now available in two volumes: [Judge Dredd Day Of Chaos: The Fourth Faction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQC6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQC6&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WwQ9p4xg7oCWPB0yRzSNVTdL06S181wNjy2bJXDjpZi9DKXuZFZaOxLcgR2-tCLDzQ6UFrW0YCfaelWUx4PxoV8CdNkDmcbPK27VP21C3K-iouX6S401ISgcFmE7Kw=s0-d) and [Judge Dredd Day Of Chaos: Endgame](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHJVQDA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHJVQDA&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/xXVjjED8MxN8XGq6n3QPtAeDOytiJZvzHpa-bfZRv7g8Nb72ZbX92-SSXLgFJqbhEW_rJpbm4xN0WRee6NH7F9qyqHtLl7fkm7o_rxczVvL0PWvz8kN8mHEoR-9fnw=s0-d).)

Is there a **story from which \*Dredd\*-the-movie was adapted**? No, there isn't. (From what I can tell, the movie effectively takes place a little while before the beginning of the comics series.) However, Olivia Thirlby's character Cassandra Anderson makes one of her memorable early appearances in "Judge Death Lives," in the aforementioned [*Complete Case Files 05*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781080283/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1781080283)![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/kXChuX5clDhQ3B32xjQim96iT5a3SgVCspL0jrKtfZKK4twADGRId96MXAyeLnGHDU-dRM6TDCvWgwn2LAHeSGQJ9YO6kOuol7iDbrXeLaiFl18Uk-uVkeA=s0-d). (UPDATE: There is, however, a one-shot comic book sequel to the movie that's also available in digital form: [Dredd: Underbelly](http://shop.2000adonline.com/products/digital_dredd_underbelly).)

If you want to **read everything in order**, there's always the blog you're looking at right now: I'm writing about all the non-redundant collections of *Dredd* comics in the publication order of the first story they include that hasn't already been covered (with a few exceptions). There are a lot of them--counting spinoffs with the same setting, there are currently about 75 volumes' worth of material, and that's not counting the hundreds of episodes that haven't yet been reprinted. 


And the **best books**? The general favorites among fans are everything named above, as well as the British collection [Complete Case Files 14](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906735298/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=readcomi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1906735298)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Z06k0vMg-2IK7jpN-nNxTYHty3isz61mH5Oab40CA1Xeizky-KO1uQlfDjhhGGcummV_q0HQzaV_KiG6R2dEJ6tA3VpDV7Z2fDDFplTUsG2BZEemw_KVRLo=s0-d), which collects the "Necropolis" storyline (and serves as the payoff to another few years' worth of stories). My personal faves also include *Brothers of the Blood* and the spinoffs *Chopper: Surf's Up*, *Mega-City Undercover Vol. 02: Living the Low Life*, *The Taxidermist* and [Devlin Waugh: Red Tide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904265294/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1904265294&linkCode=as2&tag=readcomi-20)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/2bFMeb0RWp7zJyJoLLzhPl3J7FptyA2aer4BE3_dQLUKKBEhw8kxN4dCFHeEt3JdUHDkO544Qh8HgYIzmcuaE64S8o_PZzs5B6Dzhfu4ywg3j-Cw9BN4QUSiOyzyUA=s0-d).)

### Rick and Morty

People say all Rick and Morty comics are good. At least that's what they say about the main run.

### Silent Hill

> Are all the Silent Hill comics garbage?

10: *Past Life* and *Downpour: Anne's Story* are very good out of the ones I've read.

> 5: Those were great. I enjoyed Sinner's Reward, too. The art in Past Life is just amazing. Of course, I am a Menton3 fangirl.

3: The ones released in the early 2000's I've heard were not very good, but I've never read them so idk. The ones Tom Waltz has written are pretty good. Sinner's Reward is my personal favorite, but I liked the *Downpour* comics too.

---

5: *Anne's Story* and *Past Life* are the best comics in the Silent Hill series. Anne's story is the Downpour DLC we never got and Past Life connects to Downpour as well and has amazing artwork. All the other comics are pretty terrible. I really wish we could have gotten those Japanese mobile comics by Ito :(

> 1: This is the correct answer.
>
> Also, there is one crazy short Ito comic available here: http://www.silenthillmemories.net/publications/sh_white_hunter_en.htm
>
> The best bet for Silent Hill fans would be to read Junji Ito's work. It contains the same feeling, but in independent short stories of cosmic horror madness. https://junji-ito-index.tumblr.com/the-index

3: I'm currently reading Silent Hill 2's official novelization.

Gives the story a whole new dimension.

100% recommended!

---

8: They’re not generally well received, check out Linkara Atop The 4th Wall. He reviewed them a while back

7: *Past Life* was good and there was at least one more that was good, and everything else was laughably bad.

7: Fun fact - there are two comics made by Team Silent members - Hiroyuki Owaku and Masahiro Ito.

1. Cage of Cradle - it's about Lisa and her boyfriend.
2. Double Under Dusk - it's about father who loses his son. However, they were made for Japanese market only :(

### Star Trek

3: Peter David's work is generally pretty good. I loved Who Killed Captain Kirk? when I read it way back in high school.

2: Star Trek: *Starfleet Academy*, Star Trek: Boldly Go Vol 1 & 2, Star Trek: Countdown

2: IDW series.

2: As for stuff running now, John Byrne's New Visions is both bizarre and straight out of TOS. Many others are also very good.

Marvel and DC published lots of good stuff in the 80s and 90s, though much of it takes place in the movie era. They are all available on one cd that I think you can still get on amazon. Definitely the best value.

1: I've enjoyed the Star Trek TNG Mirror Broken series. It follows the Mirror universe versions of the Next Generation crew, a fun little 'what if' series.

I also liked the first few issues of Star Trek: Waypoints. One has Geordi as the Captain with a crew of Data.

Lastly, the second Doctor Who and Star Trek crossover was pretty fun. I think [Linkara did a review if it](https://youtu.be/qbknLNB8DcM).

---

5: I don't like a good portion of the later Marvel stuff, but I *love* *STARFLEET ACADEMY*. It's under 20 issues and follows Nog at the Academy with lots of clever tie-ins to the Dominion War and classic trek. There's a really awesome two-parter that brings the cadets to Talos IV and it's pure fanboy fun with some really great characters. Bizarrely, the book's artist went on to direct THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS.

3: I would say that *Starfleet Academy* and *Early Voyages* are the two good Marvel ongoings.

> Good call! Early Voyages is also fantastic. It would be cool if one day both series get proper endings somehow.

4: It seems noone has yet mentioned Countdown, soo...

STAR TREK: COUNTDOWN! Also Star Trek: Nero and Star Trek: Spock (reflections)

---

3: The "Star Trek: Ongoing" series is pretty good in my opinion. They're the only available tie-in to the Abrams-verse timeline and they're overseen by the writers of the movies, making more canon than others.

They also did a decent job with the movie tie-in comics, the prequel and the story behind some of the deleted scenes. The actual movie adaptation was pretty bad, as is the case with most adaptations.

The only other one I've read is Hive, written by Brannon Braga. It's got one issue to go, but so far its pretty fan-fictiony and it's kind of a re-hash.

2: Hive is okay. It takes place some time after Nemesis, so no Mr. Data, Riker and Troi are married, Worf is still an ambassador, and the rest of the crew are scattered to the wind. The problem it has is the same that most Star Trek properties have: There is a need for fan service. The fans expect the original crew to get together to solve this, but they also want them frozen in amber the way they last saw them.

Personally, I am mixed about it. It would make sense for Riker, Worf and Picard to work together, but the rest of the crew have gone on with their lives and should not come back because of expectations.

As for the other series, I've heard good things about it, but I have not made room for it in my pull list.

> Dark Mirror. http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Mirror

---

3: The ones with green lantern (Star Trek/Green Lantern) were cool. Haven't really looked into them, intend to.

2: The Star Trek X-men (Star Trek/X-Men) crossovers from the 90s were both really good.

1: Most of them are not great tbh, I've read a few and the only ones I can recommend are The Enterprise Experiment, Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever, and the TNG Mirror Universe series.

The Enterprise Experiment is a sequel to the Enterprise Incident written by the TOS writer and script editor DC Fontana. It has a real feeling of a lost TOS Script adapted to a comic.

The most well-received Star Trek comics I've seen (not just among Trekkies but among comic book enthusiasts in general) are the TNG Mirror Universe series. They never touched the Mirror Universe (*Mirror Broken*) on TNG so it's fertile ground. It also shows the eventual fate of Mirror Spock. It was so well received that Eaglemoss made a model out of the Mirror Enterprise D for their collection https://shop.eaglemoss.com/usa/star-trek-starships/iss-enterprise-ncc-1701-d

Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever is an adaptation of Ellison's original script that got heavily rewritten. Opinions differ on whether it's better than the final episode, but it's certainly worth taking a look.

1: *Early Voyages*, which was basically a Captain Pike series, was pretty solid, old-school *Trek* (and even more intriguing after *Discovery*'s second season).

1: Boldy Go is really great. I couldn't put them down.

---

2: If you can get your hands on some Gold Key issues from the 60's, those are pretty interesting. But for something more reasonable, Barr and David wrote a bunch of original series and TNG comics for DC in the late 80's and early 90's that are pretty good. There's some DS9 comics from Malibu in the 90's which are ok, but I think I might just have a blind spot for anything DS9.

Over the past few years, Tipton has been writing some pretty good TNG comics. The Mirror Universe minis are especially good, *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*. Terra Incognita came after that, it was ok. The current one is The Q Conflict, and is only 1 issue in. Not sure on it yet. I've heard good things about the Discovery comics, but never bothered to pick them up.

### Star Wars

5: The best of the new canon IMO are Aphra, Poe Dameron, all the Vaders, and the older Lando miniseries. The main flagship series is middle of the road.

4: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars Legacy!

From the new canon, I liked a lot of the Vader 2015 run, Vader down especially. Haven't kept up to date with anything current though.

> 6: The new Vader run is just as good, if not better, than the 2015 version, so I'd highly recommend it. The *Doctor Aphra* series too.

4: *Knights of the Old Republic* was great fun, dramatic, and inventive. *Republic* told an excellent Quinlan Vos story across a few years and into the Clone Wars. *Agent of the Empire* was great too.

In canon, the current *Darth Vader* (I guess he means *Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*) series has been excellent. The first *Lando* mini-series is probably his best story and one of the best in canon so far, and the *Poe Dameron* series is well worth checking out.

EDIT: And the *Doctor Aphra* series has been absolutely bonkers.

3: legends: dawn of the jedi

canon: darth vader - dark lord of the sith

2: I haven't read a lot of Legends, but the best series in canon so far has been Charles Soule's Darth Vader series (*Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*). Sometimes they use the title Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith because there was already one Vader series.

---

11: [Soule's canon *Darth Vader* series](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith). Excellent story, art, and writing. Nice for newcomers.

4: Start with the Vader comics, they're by far the best of the current comic canon. There was a 2015 series set after ANH and a 2017 series set in Vaders early days. The 2017 series is the best. You can buy them in collected editions:
https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith

> 3: I agree 100%! The 2017 Vader series has easily been the best Marvel has put out, as far as Star Wars comics.

3: What are your favorite characters/settings in Star Wars right now?

Of the post-Disney comics, the two runs of Vader stories are probably the most popular (for good reason). The Lando and the Obi-Wan & Anakin miniseries are both really great, too.

From Legends, the Legacy series and the Tales of the Jedi comics are both really highly rated.

3: First off I would just like to say that all the Legends comics as well as the NEU comics (on a six month delay) are available on Marvel Unlimited

For a lot of good lists check out [r/StarWarsEU](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsEU/) or [r/starwarscanon](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarscanon/). Also are you just interested in comics or books as well? Also [r/starwars](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwars/) has some archived threads about what books to read on its FAQ.

IF you would like to check on some books your self I suggest using Wookieepedia

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Legends_comics

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_comics

I will give you some of my personal favorites.

Legends (The old canon universe up till the disney purchase in 2015)

Comics:

Tales of the Jedi (Sets the lore and history for the Jedi and Sith that the entire Legends EU would use. And that the NEU is still basing some small parts on)

*Knights of the Old Republic* (A sort of Tie-in to the game but focused on new characters. You have never read about a Jedi like Zayne Carrick before)

Star Wars Republic (The Clone Wars show before the Clone Wars show)

Rebellion/Empire (A lot of good stories mainly about Luke but staring some others as well.

Star Wars Tales (Some true and some not so true stories. Think the most recent point of view book. Also SKIPPY WAS NEVER CANON)

Legacy of the Force (While the NJO series would give some more background all you need to know is that its 137ABY and Luke's great gandson is a force using pirate with a attitude problem)

Now for the NEU/Canon

Comics:

Vader 2015/*2017* (Both Vader series are worth a read)

Poe (They are trying to make Poe and Black Squadron the Rogue Squadon of the NEU and its working. Also get to learn more about Lor San Tekka as well)

Aphra (About a rogue archeologist and her mission to steal everything in the galaxy)

Shattered Empire (Adventures with our heroes days after Endor seen though the eyes of Poe's mom)

Darth Maul (Maul killing people is fun)

Star Wars 2015 (The art is terrible, the characterization is bad, the stories are either great or medicore. But it is the main flagship comic)

Age Of miniseries (which tells stand alone stories from the main three eras of the movies)

---

10: The Obi-Wan and Anakin comic is one if my favorite, along with Poe Dameron!

7: Don't limit yourself to the canon comics! The best Star Wars comics out there are some of the older non-canon ones that were originally published by Dark Horse. They *should* all be on Marvel unlimited. My favourite on-goings were *Republic*/*Dark Times* (same series, had a name change after the story caught up to a certain infamous galactic event involving a 66th order - though, on the balance, I feel like the *Dark Times* books are better and you could totally start with them), and *Knights of the Old Republic*. There are a few shorter series or parts of on-goings that really stand out, too. Any of the *Darth Vader and the [insert subtitle]* series are great, except *...Lost Command,* which I felt was pretty weak. The final arc of *Tales of the Jedi,* which unless I'm remembering my titles wrong is called *Redemption,* is great.

Also, just as an aside, if you're in to big space adventures and you have the time to read it, check out the 2006 Marvel Cosmic event *Annihilation* - if you like Star Wars, you'd probably like it, too. [Here's a link to a reading order!](http://comicbookreadingorders.com/marvel/events/annihilation-reading-order/)

7: Lando is the best of the new comics, I think. It's an interesting, self-contained story. There aren't too many outlandish things (I'm looking at you, Poe) and it really adds a lot to Lando's character and motivations. It's really well written, and even adds something extra to ESB for me, which is quite a feat. I can't recommend it enough!

---

1: Ledgends Canon:

Tales of the Jedi (Takes place a long time ago and talks about the start of the Sith and some important Lords and Jedi Masters)

*KOTOR* (acctually focused on a different jedi and not Revan but still a great read)

Republic/The Clone Wars (focused on the era between Naboo and ep 2 then moves onto arcs dealing with the Clone Wars)

Rebellion/Empire (Stories from the Rebellion and Empire and shows a more neutral imperial view)

Legacy (Takes place 75 years after the death of Luke/Han/Leia. Lots of intersting characters and cool fights)

Smaller ones: Mara Jade emperors hand, Dark Times, X-wing, Jedi hunt.

Canon:

Star Wars (The main title detailing Han/leia/luke after Yavin)

*Darth Vader* (Enough said)

Kannan: The last padawn (Kannan dealing with the death of his master and order 66)

Shattered Empire (Lead up to TFU)

Poe Dameron (New Comic just started)

*Obi wan* & *Anakin* ( cool adventures and getting to see the two interact)

Here is a list of all comics Ledgends and Disney Canon for you to look at. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_comics

Amazon, Comixology, Dark Horse, Marvel are all great legal places to get the comics. Though if money is tight there are Kickass places to get them. Though thats Pirating them and that would be Bad

### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

6: I would start with the *IDW* comics. It's probably the best incarnation of the turtles thus far. (or at least the first 50 issues that I've read was)

3: Please take a look at our [Comic Book Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/3egxa6/official_rtmnt_comic_book_primer/). If you take a few minutes to read through the whole thing, you should be able to get a good idea what series fits your desire. But as others have said, the *IDW* series is real good. It isn't as dark as the Mirage series, but the story is far better since it has been well organized throughout its existence.

1: I would suggest one of three starting points:

If you are ready to deep dive from the beginning, go back to the Mirage Vol. 1 issues. (The first TMNT comics.) They are 80's independent comics, so they may not be to your taste. But as a big TMNT fan, it is at least worth reading the ones done by Eastman & Laird which is roughly the first 11 issues, Return to New York (three issues) and City at War. All of those stories were reprinted by IDW and should be available on comixology.

If you just want something to read and would prefer a modern take, start with *IDW's* current series. It's a fresh reboot though it does build off ideas and characters done in previous versions.

Since you specifically mentioned the 80's Turtles though, your best bet may be the Archie series. It essentially took the cartoon Turtles and then built their own world around them. *IDW* has reprinted the first 20 to 30 issues of that series as trade paperbacks as well. That's probably the easiest and cheapest way to get them.

> 3: The IDW series falls about midway between the original Mirage series and the cartoon Turtles.

---

> Where's a good place to start reading TMNT comics?

2: Comixology has the whole series!

2: If you're actually wanting to get into TMNT comics, I suggest starting with our [Comic Book Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/3egxa6/official_rtmnt_comic_book_primer/)

If you're looking for the shortest and most concise answer, I recommend starting with either:

1. The old school Mirage series (this is the true original origin of the TMNT). The first volume can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1613770073/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1497874868&sr=8-1&keywords=mirage+vol+1)
2. The first *IDW* volume. This is debatable the best iteration of the TMTN comic. Purchase link [here](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1631401114/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497874857&sr=8-1&keywords=idw+volume+1)

There are an overwhelming amount of comics for someone just starting out. Feel free to ask us any questions! The comics are phenomenal, and I think you would enjoy the comics if you're looking for a more adult-themed version of the show. IDW is my personal favorite.

> Nice!! Hope you enjoy it. In my opinion, if you start to really enjoy IDW, then pick up the Mirage collection volume 1. That's really the first main story arc. It's worth a read at some point, but the Mirage story is all over the place starting after that arc. Let us know how you like *IDW*!

1: I personally like the *IDW* collections. They are hard bound editions, full color and contain the main series and the micro series in chronological order. I went this route after trying to read them digitally and quickly learned I was not understanding the references of the micro series as they weren't included. They may be included in the Comixology, but when i downloaded the issues for Kindle, there were not.

I order the books from Amazon and they are normally below $40. They are fantastic collector pieces and are stories I turn to often. Here is a link to Vol. 1. https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1631401114/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1497846307&sr=8-3&keywords=idw+collection

The series is fantastic, you won't be disappointed.

---

> Must read TMNT runs

7: For $35, you can get [Vol. 1 (issues 1-8)](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Collection/dp/1613770073) of the famous Mirage Studios run in hardcover. It's known for being more gritty and adult compared to the animated series.

For something more recent, try the [*IDW series*](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Volume/dp/1613771398) ($13 for issues 1-4). It's a reboot set in NYC with some interesting twists on the original world.

Happy reading!

4: Definitely read the original Mirage run (mostly, just the stuff by Eastman & Laird, found in the Ultimate Collection HC's) and *the current IDW* ongoing. For the latter, I would recommend starting at the beginning and reading all the tie-ins like the micro-series one-shots, mini-series, etc. They've really put together an excellent narrative with lots of classic elements and great new twists. Here's a pretty good [reading order](http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/showthread.php?t=36475) for the IDW stuff.

Outside of that, I haven't actually read any of Vol. 2 (also Mirage), 3 (Image), or 4 (Mirage? Done by Peter Laird). Vol. 2 is really short and I haven't heard much about it. Vol. 3 is basically considered non-canon at this point, and from what I gather runs very far afield from what was established by the original comics, cartoons, and movie. It seems like a "love it" or "hate it" sort of thing. Vol. 4 seems to have a small but very devoted fan-base, but I don't know much about that one either.

> http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.com/2014/09/on-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-vol-2.html

4: *City at War* (Mirage v1 #50-62) is widely viewed as the best TMNT run, it's the arc that every other arc is compared to basically. The recent *City Fall* (IDW 21-28 - Volume 3 I guess) was incredibly good as well, very comparable to City at War in terms of quality). Return to New York (Mirage v1 19-21 plus Tales of TMNT v2 70) was also a fantastic run.

2: Original Mirage volume 1 of course. Get the Ultimate Collections. Every single one of them. Brilliant stuff.

the new Eastman/Waltz run on IDW is okay, not great, though. The micro series and various miniseries (Secret History of the Foot, Utrom Empire, Turtles in Time) related to it have been extremely good, though.

Also, Tales of the TMNT volume 2, published by Mirage by various writers and artists, is something any TMNT fan can greatly appreciate. [IDW is starting to publish them in collected but I don't know how far they'll go.](http://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Tales-ebook/dp/B00HYIC9JQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1411233211&sr=8-3&keywords=tales+of+the+tmnt) Also, they've collected the volume 1 Tales which is cool, too. It's the first two volumes of the Tales trades.

### The Witcher

The quality of the comics issued by Dark Horse

> So, it seems that I fell in love with this series. I started the GOTY edition last week on PS4 - since then, I put 35 hours in the game, read the two short story collections, pre-ordered Thronebreaker, purchased all the novels and the No Man's Land steelbook, and ordered the Ciri, Yennefer and Geralt figures and the World of the Witcher book. I noted that on top of the figures, Dark Horse also released some comics / graphic novels. I read that these are set on different periods in the overall Witcher timeline, but the stories in the comics are not fully canon as there are some differences compared to the source material. Are they still worth a read? There is a nice limited boxed set available in my country for 35 bucks that includes House of Glass, Fox Children and Curse of Crows, but if they are significantly inferior to the books / the game, then I'd skip those. Any recommendation? Many thanks.

5: They're awful. You can find better fanfiction on the internet.

4: Games aren't canon too, but they're of much higher quality than those God awful comic books.

3: I've only read the one with covers by Mike Mignola (House of Glass) but that one was pretty fun and the interior art was rad.

2: The graphic novels are okay, but far from essential reading. They have no narrative connections that expand or otherwise make it necessary to understand the plot of any of the games or the books. So unless you're a hardcore completionist who needs to peruse every piece of witcher fiction there is, they can be safely skipped. Yet I suppose I could think of worse ways to pass the time. Albeit better, too.

2: I don't recommend Fox Children, because as an adaptation of a subplot from the books I think it misses some crucial... something, in translation. It's just not as good imo. I highly recommend Curse of Crows, though, because any comic about Ciri and Geralt on the Path together is great.

---

The Witcher comics

> Hello fellow Witcher fans,
>
> I'm pretty new to this sub and I was wondering if anyone has read the comics and if they are worth reading. I started playing the games fairly recently (I have put in so many hours into each) and absolutely fell in love with them and the lore. I'm on my first NG+ and currently rereading the novels. I've watched the Polish show, which was barely tolerable (idk they made the story changes that they did). I also watch a ton of Witcher youtube videos, mostly lore videos and I seen some fan made videos.
>
> So, basically I'm looking for other Witcher material until Season of Storms comes out. Are the comics worth buying and reading? Any other suggestions for me?

2: The comics are definitely worth it. Very dark and true to the world of the Witcher. I recommend them. My only complaint is that in the last volume the art was a bit different from the last two volumes and I didn’t like it as much but I still say you should read it.

2: I wouldn't say the comics are as good as the books or the games. And the art gets dodgy in places. But they're not terrible either. I'd say they're about the quality comic book tie-in products for movies or video games usually are in terms of writing.

Definitely better than the Polish series though.

Comic Books Reading Order (with books and games)?

> So I'm starting to read through the books and comics. I found this guide here about the books:
>
> https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3qm8p9/so_you_want_to_read_the_witcher_books_guide/
>
> But what about the Comics? Do the comics that came with the games come before the Dark Horse series? I'm also guessing that since the comics are related to the games, that I should read the books first, then the comics. Is this the correct order for everything?:
>
> **Books First:**
>
> - The Last Wish
> - Sword of Destiny
> - Blood of Elves
> - Time of Contempt
> - Baptism of Fire
> - The Tower of Swallows
> - Lady of the Lake
>
> Then:
>
> - Witcher 1 (Game)
> - Reasons of State (Comic)
> - Witcher 2 (Game)
> - Matters of Conscience (Comic)
> - Witcher 3 (Game)
> - House of Glass (Comic)
> - Fox Children (Comic)
> - Witcher 3 DLC (Game)
> - Killing Monsters (Comic)
> - Curse of Crows (Comic)
>
> Thanks!

3: Are we talking about chronology? Then...

"Reasons of State" takes place between the *Sword of Destiny* and *Something More* short stories.

"Matters of Conscience" takes place after *The Witcher 2 - Assassins of Kings*, following an ending where Geralt chose Iorveth's path and let the dragon live.

"Killing Monsters" takes place shortly before the beginning of *The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt*.

"Curse of Crows" takes place after *The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt*. It follows an ending state where Ciri became a witcher and Geralt romanced Yennefer.

"House of Glass" takes place at an unknown time. But most likely it's before the five novels, at the same time as the short stories.

"Fox Children" is an adaptation of two chapters in *Season of Storms*. It is technically non-canon since it's not a 1:1 adaptation (with some pretty notable changes to boot) and the games follow the books.

So, for the complete experience:

- *The Road of No Return* (short story, no official translation, fan translation available)
- *Season of Storms* (novel)
- *The Last Wish* (short story collection)
- *House of Glass* (comic, somewhere hereabouts)
- *Sword of Destiny* (short story collection, up to *The Sword of Destiny* short story within it)
- *Reasons of State* (comic)
- *Something More* (the final story in the *Sword of Destiny* collection)
- *Blood of Elves* (novel)
- *Time of Contempt* (novel)
- *Baptism of Fire* (novel)
- *The Tower of the Swallow* (novel)
- *The Lady of the Lake* (novel)
- *The Witcher* (video game)
- *The Witcher 2 - Assassins of Kings* (video game)
- *Matters of Conscience* (comic, only if you picked the Iorveth path and spared the dragon)
- *Killing Monsters* (comic)
- *Killing Monsters* (cinematic trailer/short film - yes, this is part of the game canon too)
- *The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt* (video game, with the *Hearts of Stone* expansion either within the main story or post-game)
- *Curse of Crows* (comic, only if Ciri became a witcher and Yennefer was romanced)
- *Blood and Wine* (video game expansion)
- *A Night to Remember* (cinematic trailer/short film)

Whew.

Clarification: The books are still the only "hard" canon. But this list shows where the expanded stories take place around them.

## Best comics by literary genres

### Fantasy

19: **Sandman** is at, or near, the top for a lot of people. Neil Gaiman's first major work (AFAIK), following the life and times of Morpheus, the immortal, anthropomorphic personification of dreaming. Slow start but a magnificent finish.

Also a Gaiman work, Marvel 1602 is superheroes in ~~Victorian~~ Elizabethan England, which is as fantasy as it gets.

**Saga** by Brian K. Vaughan looks like a scifi if spaceships and robots are enough to define a genre, but it also has at least one dragon, spaceships that are made from trees, ghosts, an ongoing war between magic-users and tech-users, and satyrs and fairies (though they're not called that). The only thing wrong with it is that it's not finished yet.

Last of all, *Fables* by Bill Willingham! All the characters in all the fairy tales (at least, the ones in the public domain) are real, but they've been chased out of their respective worlds by the Adversary, a faceless immortal emperor with deep pockets and an unstoppable army. The *Fables* find refuge on Earth, where they deal with issues of diaspora, prejudice, and small-town politics. Highlights include a *deep* cast of nuanced characters, a midseason twist that *will* make you swear out loud, and one of the hands-down best love stories in modern fiction.

> 4: All of these, so very much. Even the little spinoffs from *Fables* are brilliant, and the Lucifer spinoff from **Sandman** is equally interesting.

11: *Monstress* is stunning.

It got a rush job at the end of its run but Hinterlands was a quite a good read each month.

**Saga** obviously gets mentioned quite a bit. Not sure if I would count East of West or not but its a pretty fantastic Comic as well.

Some others:

- *Fables*
- *Rat Queens*
- Mouse Guard
- Red Sonja and a few of the other Dynamite titles.
- Nimona - maybe that was a web comic first? Not sure, it had a print version.
- Locke & Key
- For some lighter fare - I Hate Fairyland. It is complete over the top nonsense but it is a really fun read.

[Check out the big thread of recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sfzd/rfantasy_bingo_recommendations_thread/) for the Bingo challenge. Graphic Novel is one of the categories.

**Edit**: Oh man completely forgot about Black Magick which is kind of shaping up to be Urban Fantasy. I've only read the 6 issues but Greg Rucka does some fantastic world building. Definitely worth checking out.

> 2: I own Black Magick, but need to read it. I've read a *lot* by Rucka over the years, but was disappointed with some of his more recent stuff like his Jad Bell book series, and that, combined with my being burned out on comics, has led to it languishing (along with some others like Monstress). But I'll try to push it higher.

10: I just love *Rat Queens*

9: The ones that you might not think of - Goscinny & Uderzo's Asterix is ostensibly for kids, but a LOT of fun for adults who can understand all the in-jokes. And if you think they are funny in English, remember it is translated from French originally.

Jeff Smith's **Bone**, which has dragons, heroes, cowboys, rat creatures, and a wonderful combination of epic adventure and small scale humour.

7: Berserk by Kentaro Miura one of my favorite manga

6: **Sandman** and Books of Magic by Gaiman. https://www.goodreads.com/series/40372-the-sandman https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17727.The_Books_of_Magic?ac=1&from_search=true

Lucifer and The Unwritten by Carey. https://www.goodreads.com/series/59893-lucifer https://www.goodreads.com/series/55720-the-unwritten

*Fables* by Willingham. https://www.goodreads.com/series/54296-fables

Artesia The Eisner-award winner by Smylie https://www.goodreads.com/series/121190-artesia

The Wizard's Tale by Busiek is fun, sweet and centers on a protagonist well over 50. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685529.The_Wizard_s_Tale?ac=1&from_search=true

*Conan* by Busiek. https://www.goodreads.com/series/90218-conan-ongoing-series

*The Autumnlands* by Busiek. https://www.goodreads.com/series/160012-the-autumnlands

Groo by Aragonés https://www.goodreads.com/series/50300-groo-the-wanderer

Aria by Holguin https://www.goodreads.com/series/68291-aria

Mouse Guard by Petersen https://www.goodreads.com/series/67194-mouse-guard

Thieves & Kings by Oakley https://www.goodreads.com/series/72417-thieves-kings

The Atlantis Chronicles by David is getting a HC compilation in November. It tells the history of the fall of Atlantis, and all of the civil wars, brother vs. brother rifts/wars, magic, curses, tragedies, etc. that resulted over thousands of years. https://www.goodreads.com/series/118737-the-atlantis-chronicles

5: *Rat Queens* (If you like inappropriate D&D sessions involving sex, drugs, and lots and lots of sarcasm this is for you)

Skull Kickers (This is also a comedy fantasy series where the heroes are more likely to kill the quest givers than go on the quest, it also has the best sound effect jokes I've ever seen in comics)

East of West (Equal parts western, apocalypse tale, and sci-fi that may as well be fantasy, this is a dark look at an America that never united and is now facing the three horsemen trying to end the world and one trying to stop them. Also I had dinner with the artist last year and he told me that Game of Thrones was a huge influence on the structure of the series)

Wayward (This was pitched as Buffy the Vampire Slayer goes to Japan, if you like Japanese mythology and high school drama with a lot of violence, this series is well worth checking out)

Curse Words (A fairly new comic about an evil wizard sent to our world to take it over for his master, but he finds the world endearing and decides to cut his ties with his dark lord and start a new life being a famous wizard in Manhattan. Very funny and very weird.)

Black Cloud (Another fairly new comic about the power of story and maybe alternate dimensions. Not much is known so far since only two issues are out, but this just may be the next big series)

God Country (I believe the final issue of this mini series is coming out within the next month, so a trade shouldn't be too far behind. This is a story about an old man fighting alzheimer's with a magic sword stolen from the gods. It's very emotional, but beautifully written and drawn)

Black Clover (If manga is more your thing this is the series to check out. It's a traditional shonen battle manga, but instead of ki or ninjitsu they characters are given grimoires which grow as they learn new spells and magic. Normally the most powerful mages have grimoires with four leaf clovers on the cover, but our main character gets a grimoire with five leafs and the power to nullify other magic. It's a lot of fun.)

2: MetaBaron - By Alejandro jodorowski is totally amazing. Its super dark and pretty much a fantasy story wrapped in scifi clothes. I highly recommend it.

**Saga** - by brian K. vaughan is fantastic as well. The best currently running fantasy comic right now imo.

Birthright by Joshua Williamson is pretty awesome. I've only read the first trade so far but it seemed really promising.

Headlopper by Andrew maclean is one of the most surprising and enjoyable reads ive had lately. his art is beautiful and the story is just super fun.

45: I consider **The Sandman** to be both the finest thing Neil Gaiman has ever written and the best graphic novel of all time.

It’s a fantasy series following the Lord of Dreams (who also goes by many other names) as he gets involved with the affairs of mortals. He’s one of the seven Endless, powerful entities that are older than Gods and play huge roles in human lives.

**The Sandman** is a phenomenal series that depicts Gaiman’s strengths (his creativity, dark fairy tale-esque storytelling and beautiful writing) at their absolute peak, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy read or a quality graphic novel.

25: I recommend **Bone** by Jeff Smith. Three of the main characters may have accidentally stumbled into the story from the funny papers, but the story is well told and Smith's background as an animator really shows and it is one of the most visually dynamic comics I've ever read.

16: If you count webcomics, Kill Six Billion Demons is amazing. It blends so many different mythos and religious icons into a kick ass wuxia comic.

Best part! It's free online! The artwork is often trippy, beautiful, strange. It's a lovely thing.

> 2: It's actually also available in print!

12: Easily **Saga**. Anything Brian K. Vaughan writes is gold.

7: Jeff Smith's **Bone**.
Bill Willingham's *Fables*.
And of course Neil Gaiman's **Sandman**.

All three are truly phenomenal masterpieces, each in their own way.

6: Amulet, *Rat Queens*, The Hedge Knight, East of West, Locke & Key, Lady Mechanika, Umbrella Academy, Lumberjanes.

5: I really like *Rat Queens*.

4: Berserk Manga, so freaking brutal and good. **Sandman** series by Neil Gaimon, kind of fantasy. Hellsing, bleach, Solomon Kane, Attack on Titan, all good comics/manga/graphic novels.

---

7: Berserk

> 3: Berserk is dark fantasy and it is epic in the truest sense of the word. Couldn't recommend it enough
>
> 1: Dude, I wish I was you right now. Berserk is one of those works of fiction that you wish you could experience again for the first time, learning about the world, characters, experiencing the art, all that. If you are a fan of fantasy, you'll like it probably. It's dark, almost brooding sometimes, but it is often beautiful as well. It's a damn good manga.

4: 

- *Autumnlands*
- *Conan* (esp. the b&w 1970s series)
- Head Lopper
- *Rat Queens*

> 3: *Autumnlands* is beautiful! I really enjoyed both arcs a lot. Birthright is pretty good, Arclight is an amazing one volume series from Image, and Seven to Eternity is excellent.
>
> Edit: and yes Head Lopper is killer!

4: Dark Horse has a bunch of good "*Conan*" books, and the omnibuses go on sale pretty regularly.

> 2: If you are getting trades all the numbered volumes range from good to great, the minis were hit or miss. I think it runs about 22 volumes across multiple title changes.

3: Seven to Eternity is an awesome new fantasy comic. The first two arcs have been released in trades.

3: Dynamite comics has a bunch of Pathfinder comics, as well as stuff with old pulp characters like Red Sonja.

2: If you can find the D&D comic written by John Rogers, it's quite good. Sadly, it like most D&D campaigns just ended abruptly without any real resolution, but it was one of the best books on the market at the time.

2: Seven to Eternity is great, yeah. You might also want to check out The Last Siege, *Monstress*, Eternal Empire, Sleepless, Rose, and The Realm.

2: The IDW Baldur's Gate comics are pretty decent.

2: I'm gonna second *Monstress*

1: If you are into D&D, you should definitely check out the various Pathfinder mini-series from Dynamite. As you might have guessed, they are based on the popular pen and paper RPG by PAIZO. I have enjoyed each and every one of them. A fun and exciting read for sure.

Another ongoing fantasy series I feel is underrated and deserves more love is Rose by Image.

---

11: What about [**Bone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_(comics))?

Not solely high fantasy, but it contains some (as well as some of everything else) is **Sandman**. It is a legitimate masterpiece in my opinion.

8: There's *Autumnlands* by Kurt Busiek and Ben Dewey. One volume published so far, gorgeous artwork. A cabal of wizards bring back a legendary hero to stop magic seeping away from their world, things don't go as planned.

*Rat Queens* is more comic fantasy, but still worth a look.

Parts of the *Fables* series also qualify I think, mostly those set in the Homelands.

Maybe Prince Valiant? It's not really fantasy, but it has an Arthurian setting.

There are adaptations of several fantasy novels, ranging from good (GRRM's Dunk and Egg novellas) to bad (Discworld).

I'm not sure how many Franco-Belgian comics have been translated to English, but there are many series like La Quête de l'oiseau du temps, Lanfeust etc.

As for webcomics:

[Inverloch](http://inverloch.seraph-inn.com/) and [Phoenix Requiem](http://requiem.seraph-inn.com/) by Sarah Ellerton are both finished and worth the read.

[Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/) is a great steampunk comic.

[Unsounded](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/), [A Redtail's Dream](http://www.minnasundberg.fi/artd.php) and especially [Back](http://backcomic.com/) are worth a look as well.

6: Depending on your definition of "high fantasy," there's plenty!

- *Conan* - an obvious first choice. The Marvel books by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith are fantastic, and the newer Dark Horse series by Kurt Busiek and Cary Nord are great if you're into more modern graphic storytelling.
- Birthright - a new series by Joshua Williamson put out my Image comics. A young boy goes missing and his father is suspected of killing him, driving his family apart. A year later, a grizzled man claiming to be the young boy in question appeals to his family and the police, maintaining that he's been gone 20 years in a fantasy land.
- *The Autumlands* - another Image series written by Kurt Busiek and illistrated by Benjamin Dewey and Jordie Bellaire about anthropomorphic animals in a waning period of magic who try to resurrect the lost champion in a moment of desperation.
- The Umbral - I haven't read this one yet, but it's by Antony Johnston, and that's enough for my seal of approval.

I have lots more, but my lunch break is over! Please reply if none of these do it for you!

3: Elfquest is one that I read when I was younger. In fact, I believe almost the entire series is free on for viewing on their website. It does have some sci-fi overtones, but the majority of the series is about elves with some atypical characteristics. It was the series that really got me into reading comics, so I'm still rather fond of it.

3: **Sandman**?

3: Check out some manga.

Berserk: Great, longish read, but unfinished. Don't worry though, will be finished as soon as ASOIAF is.

Shin Angyo Onshi: Completed and quite the ride.

Fullmetal Alchemist: This one is a weird hybrid and not 100% high fantasy, but very much worth a read.

Claymore: Another great one, high fantasy to a tee and with a female protagonist.

2: If you mean "high fantasy" in a literary sense (i.e. takes place in a different world from ours, like in The Lord of the Rings) there are plenty. Graphic novel adaptations of Michael Moorcock's multiverse stories and Terry Pratchett's Discworld, original productions like Thorgal and Arzach...there's a bunch.

If you mean "high fantasy" in the popular sense of "lots and lots of magic and monsters," there are plenty of those too.

2: I can recommend Dungeons & Dragons by IDW, which at its core is just about a D&D campaign.

Another one is the New 52 Demon Knights which has sorceresses, a shining knight, and a guy who transforms into a demon to fight as its main characters.

1: The Pathfinder comics are decent. They lost me around 5 issues in, but I'm not a comic guy, so it says a lot that I lasted that long. *Rat Queens* I absolutely love though.

1: Try [Ravine](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/ravine) by Stjepan Sejic

---

20: *Fables*. **Sandman**. **Bone**.

16: **The Sandman** is the best graphic novel I have ever read, fantasy or otherwise. It’s truly a classic and arguably the greatest thing Neil Gaiman has written to date.

12: *Rat Queens*

A group of female companions go on a bunch of D&D style adventures. Each character is a different take on fantasy species and archetypes. Hilariously awesome.

9: Does Berserk count?

> 5: fuck yeah it does ;)

9: *Monstress*	

9: The Wicked + The Divine by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie is fantastic! It's a story about a pantheon of God's who are resurrected as pop stars but will die in two years. Lots of great music references and allusions. Phonogram is another series by the same team with a similar focus on music. This one has a mage who uses BritPop as a magic system.

I also just posted a review for a book named Extremity by Daniel Warren Johnson. It's a science fiction/fantasy/post apocalyptic story with lots of blood and violence but also feeeellings.

And if you're into *Conan* I suggest checking out Prophet by Brandon Graham and his cadre of artists. It's like a weird far future scifi story heavily inspired by Howard.

8: 

0. Hellblazer - Personal favourite. Urban dark fantasy.
1. **Sandman** - Neil Gaiman's magnum opus. Probably the best fantasy GN out there.
2. Arawn - Some edgy dark fantasy about a chosen one villain.
3. Black Moon Chronicles - The final volume got translated last week. Has some of the best artwork ever.
4. *Conan* (Dark Horse stuff, especially works of Kurt Busiek) - Great art, great writing.
5. Crossgen comics - okay it's a whole publisher and they have a tonne of great series. Sigil is the most important one. Try that if you wanna check out for yourself. Seriously, most of Crossgen comics are nothing short of a 3/5.
6. Discworld, Riftwar, Wheel of Time and some other famous fantasy series have a few comics. (Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser by Mignola and Elric comics by Roy Thomas are especially great)
7. Siegfried by Alex Alice - Retelling of Der Ring des Nibelungen. Changes a lot of things but only for the good. Such a shame the [animated movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDoJMwjs0I8) got cancelled.
8. DC comics' He-Man - Good enough art (reminiscent of the 2002 show) with some innovative storylines.
9. Grant Morrison's 18Days - adaptation of Mahabharata.
10. Ravine - Stjepan Sejic fucking unchained.
11. Requiem Vampire Knight - supreme edge with good characters. Fun to read.
12. Umbral - never read but heard a lot about it.
13. Sigilverse - Crossgen had this line of like 15 series set in the same universe (but on different planets) where every hero (NOT superheroes, only fantasy or sci-fi heroes) had a mark granted to them. It was called the Sigil. Do read it if you like Sanderson's Cosmere. Must read ones are Sigil, Scion, Mystic, Sojourn, Crossgenesis, The First, El Cazador.

7: Some of my favorites:

Girl Genius- A gaslamp fantasy (magic/mad-science/steampunk) webcomic that is chock full of mad science, melodrama, and (most importantly) humor. I've been following this webcomic for more than a decade.

Gunnerkrigg Court- A science fantasy webcomic that takes the "magical school" trope to some rather weird and unsettling places. I've been following this webcomic for about 7 years.

Chew- A comedy horror comic that combines the "magic detective" trope with cannibalism and gratuitous gore. Hilarious and cringe-inducing disgusting. I nearly vomited while reading it. *This is a compliment.* Takes a hard-line stance against chickens1 . 60 issues.

^1 Explanation on the first few pages of the first issue.

4: Thorgal by Jean van Hamme and Grzegorz Rosinski

A very pulpy fantasy series with a sprinkling of sci fi and psychedelic elements. The main character Thorgal Aegirsson is a great warrior who only wants to live in peace with his family but his gets tangled up in one adventure after the other. The series can be a bit bleak at times but it is also very inventive and wonderfully weird. I've heard it compared to *Conan* but I've never read any of those books or comic books so I can't say for sure if they are similar.

Rice Boy by Evan Dahm

A webcomic that can be read here: [First page](http://www.rice-boy.com/see/index.php?c=001)

It follows Rice Boy who is a strange little creature that might be the chosen one to fulfill a prophecy. The drawings for some reason reminds me of the Moomin Trolls but the scope of the story is more like The Lord of the Rings. There is also a Gandalf-like character that sets the events in motion. For some reason this character is a robot with a TV for a head. The TV shows pictures from old movies to convey his mood and feelings. This character might have inspired the similar designed character in Saga.

I can't recommend this story enough. It's strange, funny, weird and very moving at times.

Valhalla by Peter Madsen and Henning Kure

A humoristic and quite faithfull retelling of Norse Mythology. It started in the seventies (which is pretty obvious from the humor) and ended about 10 years ago when they told their version of Ragnarok. If you like Norse mythology and don't mind a bit of silly humor I can definitely recommend this series.

I also love **Sandman** by Neil Gaiman but I wanted to recommend some comics that aren't usually talked about on this forum. I agree that almost all post about novels and I have thought about doing some post about interesting fantasy comic books. I might make some more expansive posts about these three comic books some time in the future to get a bit more variety on this great forum.

4: The Mignolaverse (Hellboy)

4: *Hellboy* is probably the best fantasy American comics has produced (including, yes, **Sandman**), and I don't just the main comic, which is fantastic, but the entire universe built around it. Also note that there is spoilers in the links below, nothing big or revealing, mostly first issue stuff, but you've been warned.

Some other stuff I'm reading/looking into:

Birthright, by Joshua Williamson, Andrei Bressan, and Adriano Lucas. It's a kind of deconstructist portal fantasy in the vein of Narnia, except the kid comes back an adult, and, well a whole of stuff has happened into between those two points. At it's core it's very much a family drama. The art team also is [mind-blowing](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Birthright-Comic-Book-Vol.-1.jpg).

Black Cloud, by Jason Latour, Ivan Brandon, Greg Hinkle, and Matt Wilson. It's a pretty strange story which it's backstory, and world-building isn't spelled for you, but largely implied by the characters. The magic is pretty interest as well--it's basically a world in which the strongest story has the strongest magic. It's, following that, about the power of story. And what will be a running theme here, the [art is great](https://imagecomics.com/uploads/releases/07_BlackCloud05.jpg).

Black Magick, by Greg Rucka and Nicola Scott. Great witch/urban fantasy story will all the classic elements: secret societies, cabals of monsters, and a investigatory type right in the middle of it. It also has one of the best visual representations of magic in all of comics. It is mostly drawn in grey tones, except for magic which is coloured, and it's [great](https://www.herocollector.com/Content/ArticleImages/9ef100f3-66e0-4dfe-9d77-ab3b167a83c3.jpg)

Curse Words, by Charles Soule, and Ryan Browne. Pretty funny/wacky story about a wizard from a different world coming to our world a setting up a kind of 'help you' shop. I'd say it's a comedy at it's heart but there is a lot more going on under the hood. Ryan Browne has a real talent for comedic timing and action.

East of West, by Jonathan Hickman, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin. A dystopian, alt-history, weird western about the literal end days starring Death, one of the horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the archetypical cowboy out for vengeance. Despite all that, I'd say this story is very much a: epic fantasy with the scope of epic fantasy, and a character piece, filled in political intrigue. Hickman has a great ear for dialogue, and the East of West is his best work in the terms of that. The art is, likewise, great, and probably the best thing Dragotta has ever done. I'll also plug Hickman's out work here: The Black Monday Murders, a police procedural of sorts about economic clans who also black wizards, and The Dying and the Dead, a kind of pulp adventure. Both are great, and having amazing art, but both come out very infrequently.

Eternal Empire, by Jonathan Luna, and Sarah Vaughn, is the first proper secondary world fantasy, and it's only ten-issue long, with a simply story, but I've really enjoyed it. It does a lot of it's emotional storytelling be told through the visuals, (which many people might not like, but I do), and the world is pretty unique, which is also done a lot through it's visuals.

Head Lopper, by Andrew Maclean who does everything by the lettering on the book, is the best sword-and-sorcery comic on the shelves with some of the best, cleanest [art](https://pre00.deviantart.net/82c3/th/pre/i/2014/325/1/8/head_lopper_2_spread_by_andrew_ross_maclean-d875jtr.jpg) in the entire industry. If you like that style of story I highly recommend Head Lopper.

Isola, by Brendan Fletcher, Karl Kerschl, and Msassyk is a pretty knew comic, only three issues out, but it's got a couple things going for it, it's art is [gorgeous](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/711/a1/c0907939f907c30f3498129710a94fe1.jpg), so far it's story is pretty intriguing, but one of it's main sources of inspiration in Studio Ghibli. If you local library doesn't get single issues like mine does (if you pester them enough), I'd wait for the trade, but so far so good.

Stalker Prism, by Sloane Leong, a kind of biopunk/magical girl school mashup, the book is very strange, can be shockingly brutal, and as is a prerequisite, the [art](https://imagecomics.com/uploads/releases/_small/PrismStalker_03-1.png) is mind-blowing.

Scales and Scoundrels, by Sebastian Girner, and Galaad. Follows the adventures of a dragon trapped in a humans body, and we've got one bigger introduction story, and a couple smaller ones, and we seem to be, like all great adventure comics, circling the Big One. The cartooning is great, the world is pretty classic fantasy, but is fun, and the main character is pretty great, proper mix of self-serving and selfless.

Sleepless, by Sarah Vaughn, and Leila Del Duca. It's a fantasy of manners filled with great court intrigue, subtle fantasy world-building (no high-magic here), and some good romance. And, of course, the art is [gorgeous](http://www.nerdspan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/samplepage-sleepless1-341x525.png).

Sword of Ages, by Gabriel Rodriguez (co-creator of Locke & Key, another great fantasy horror comic). A kind of retelling of the Matter of Britain in a very John Carter of Mars setting, it's very good as a story, but the main attraction here is really the [art](https://www.previewsworld.com/news_images/199561_1135180_1018.jpg).

And finally I want the new work by Simon Spurrier fantasy comic, Coda, he's doing with Matias Bergara. There is only two issues, but Spurrier been making very interesting fantasy comics for a long time (The Spire, Cry Havoc, Godshaper, Weavers), and is one my favourite fantasy writers going right now.

And so much more I didn't touch upon. There's a lot of good fantasy right in just American comics, and probably even more in the European side, and probably even more in Japan. If you like visual interesting fantasy comics has a lot to offer.

3: **Sandman**.

3: Girl Genius is my second favourite. It's a steampunk world full of very mad scientistist, monsters and some beautiful art work.

My all-time favourite has been mentioned a few times already..

3: My favorite graphic novel, is **Watchmen**, if you haven't read that you really need to. Also check out his run on the **Swamp Thing**.

George R.R. Martin has a short graphic novel that I really enjoyed called The Hedge Knight.

Pierce Brown has a prequel comic to his series called, Sons of Ares, not sure if the trade is out yet, but I really enjoyed it.

Sorry these might not be your thing: I've mentioned my love for Nimona recently...also I love the Lumberjanes to death...Just picked up *Mega Princess* by **Kelly Thompson**, Kelly's run on the Kate Bishop/Hawkeye book was one of my favorite comics. I was so psyched to see she's slated to write West Coast Avengers. Kelly, writing Kate and Clint? yes very much please...it feels as if the world has righted itself..at least Hawkeye-wise.

3: *Monstress*

Best grimdark Fantasy Comic since the original 13 Volumes of Berserk.

3: 

1. **Sandman** (easily the G.O.A.T.)
2. *Hellboy*
3. Hellblazer
4. The Books of Magic (Gaimen's original graphic novel and the follow-up monthly series by John Ney Rieber)
5. *Rat Queens*
6. **Saga**
7. *Fables*
8. Unwritten
9. *Conan* (especially Kurt Busiek's run at Darkhorse)

3: Hey Aristo, my name is Justin Mayhew. I am currently creating my new graphic novel: Strong Mountain. SM is a Dwarven Fantasy epic set in the frozen northlands of Eremor.

https://jtmayhew.deviantart.com/art/Dwarven-Mammoth-from-Strong-Mountain-751674491

I am just barely finishing up my first chapter, and will be deploying within a few weeks. I am trying to find my beginning audience.

I really dig the Elric comics you metioned (Stormbringer was badass). I also liked the Autumnlands stories, its quasi Fantasy-Scifi. Hope the suggestion helps.

2: GrimJack by John Ostrander. It’s an awesome mix of Sword &Sorcery, Horror and Noir.

2: Chalk up another recommendation for **Sandman** and *Monstress*.

I've very picky about art styles and don't read many graphic novels because most of them just don't float my boat that way. But Monstress blew me away. **Sandman** I'm still working on, but it's great, too.

2: Matt Wagner’s Mage. It’s an urban fantasy about a dude who turns out to be a reincarnation of King Arthur. The first third is about him learning this, starting to come to terms with his powers, and losing his mentor and most of his companions on his way to defeating an evil faery king. The second third has him rambling across America, bouncing off of reincarnations of other mythic heros, and dealing with that faery king again. The last third is in progress (the series started in the eighties, and there are gaps between each third) and sees the hero as a father, whose family becomes a target for what I assume is going to be the last hurrah of that faery king, since Wagner has been advertising the whole thing as a three-part story since the beginning.

The first third is a pretty straight Hero’s Journey; the other two play with it in various ways. Also the hero is totally a Mary Sue for Wagner. But I enjoyed it a lot and am snagging each issue off the shelf, which is pretty rare for me.

2: **Saga** by Brian K Vaughan is , in my humble opinion , the best comic ever written, and it's most definitely fantasy.

*Fables* is extremely good, with some awesome plots and great characters.

On manga i really like Rurouni Kenshin, although it may not be everyones cup of tea.

1: Stand Still Stay Silent is an excellent webcomic.

1: I have a list somewhere, which I have to find. It's *long*.

In the meantime I heartily recommend The Wizard's Tale by Kurt Busiek and David Wenzel (some editions include an intro by Charles de Lint) about a wizard named Bafflerog Rumplewhisker, who does his darndest to be evil, but somehow always gets it wrong.

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685529.The_Wizard_s_Tale

1: In no particular order: *Fables* **sandman** **swamp thing** (Brian k Vaughan) revival shadowman Rachel rising Wayward Excalibur
Journey into mystery

1: Green Valley was more recent, it’s fantastic

1: Ravine. Death Vigil. Anything by Steifan Sejic

1: Death Vigil by Stjepan Sejic. Urban fantasy-ish in which the grim reaper recruits soldiers from among those who died a worthy death to help with her fight against ancient eldritch horrors who want to enter our dimension and consumer it and their human helpers. Gorgeous art with some amazing monster designs and great characters with a lot of humor and heart.

*Monstress* by Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda. Asian inspired grimdark epic/quest fantasy about a world at war and one traumatised young woman who holds the power to end it all, one way or another.

> Pathfinder Tales & Comics

7: For Iconics stuff, the comics are good in general, but I'd specifically suggest the [Origins](http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/d/dynamiteEntertainment/pathfinderComics/origins) storyline. It's basically a prequel, so you could probably jump in with that if you wanted.

Out of the tales books, [Death's Heretic](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8oda?Pathfinder-Tales-Deaths-Heretic) is actually one of my favorite fantasy novels. But they cover a lot of thematic ground. If you like gritty horror, [Bloodbound](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9e43?Pathfinder-Tales-Bloodbound) does a good job and if you like, well, pirates, then [Pirate's Promise](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9aon?Pathfinder-Tales-Pirates-Promise) is a good place to start.

3: The comics do indeed follow the iconics (though, of course, not all of them, and not all from the beginning). You can get them in some pretty good hardcover collections as well.

3: Just started getting into Pathfinder myself and so picked up a few of the comics and a novel to try and get into the setting. <u>The comics were pretty fun, the art was occasionally a little odd</u> and not quite to my taste but still a fun read. Only grabbed one novel, Winter Witch, and whilst it wasn’t great literature, for a “shared universe” fantasy novel it was a good read. Nicely written characters, a fun plot and some good scenes. Helped me get a handle on the Inner Sea too (least some areas of it). Probably will pick up some more now.

2: The Pathfinder comics are pretty fun *and* they include write ups in the back for encounters (with maps) or random additions somewhat related to what happened in the comic. The Goblins subseries especially has weird writeups to add weird items or characters to the game.

> Good D&D Comics?

16: I'm more a [Dungeons and Doggo's](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6n9fy9/art_dungeons_and_doggos_scary_man/) man myself. [Site](https://dndoggos.com/#!#1-the-ogre)

11: *The Rat Queens* is a great comic, it's not official d&d but it has d&d in its bones. It uses d&d terminology throughout and is sorta meta with rpg stuff. It's very very fun.

11: OOTS (Order of the Stick). Great story line, with 1K+ strips for you to enjoy even with its infrequent updates.

10: Not really a D&D comic, but check out Steve Lichman, it's hilarious. Its about a dungeon community of monsters living their everyday dungeon lives, has the flavor and themes of D&D and is super accessible.

https://rapozacomics.carbonmade.com/projects/5313679

6: Critical Role is releasing a comic book of Vox Machina before they started livestreaming soon.

4: Goblins: Life through their eyes. 3x homebrew, a bit meta. Often tries to be humorous to varying degrees of success. Uploads at a pace best described as "Glacial". 1 page/month is pushing it. Still, the drama is good your first time or two around, and you have a lot to read. The art style is shiny and round.

You mentioned more classical comic style, so what about digging around to find the old Dragonlance comics?

3: *Ratqueens*

3: Seconding *Rat Queens*, also Pathfinders official comics and DNDs official comics.

Slayers ,Lodoss, and Dungeon Meshi/Delicious in Dungeon if into Manga

2: Nodwick used to be a staple of Dragon Magazine. It centers around an adventuring party and their hilariously terrible treatment of their henchman. It's not current but you can find the comics online.

2: As far as official stuff goes, have you checked out [Fell's Five](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1674789-zombieorphans.jpg)?

1: Here's a collection of different comic series on Comixology. https://www.comixology.com/search/series?search=Dungeons+%26+Dragons&lang=1

1: [DnDUI](http://www.dndui.com/webcomic/01Wits_web.php) has always been a favorite of mine

### Sci-fi

#### Cyberpunk

10: It's not light-drizzle, neon-light cyberpunk, but *Transmetropolitan* is really good. I've only read the first three volumes, but from what I've read so far, it explores a lot of problems that the author has imagined for a dystopian future. Also, the protagonist is crazy af.

6: *Judge Dredd* comics, old, but still good.

5: [*Blame!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!) is what I would describe as Goth Cyberpunk, and it's story is told through minimal dialogue, major action, and one of the Largest worlds I have ever come across. It's absolutely bananas how large of a scale we are talking.

4: Drugs and Wires

> 3: http://www.drugsandwires.fail/contents/ <<link
>
> 3: Also [dreamspace](http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/) by the same artist.

3: Try Elephantmen, it's set in the future when a group tries to create super soldiers by impregnating humans with human/animal hybrid embryos. We come in when the hybrids or 'elephantmen' are integrated into human society which at this point is a dystopian cyberpunk world. I've only read the first four omnibus graphic novels but so far it's great.

3: *Hard Boiled* is Cyberpunk as fuck.

3: Just finished reading *Tokyo Ghost* by Rick Remender and Sean Murphy and that was an enjoyable read. It has a nature v. technology (or maybe communism v. capitalism?) theme that gets a bit over thew top but the world building and central characters are interesting.

2: Stuff I've read and enjoyed:

- [Chronicles of Centrum](https://www.amazon.de/Die-Chroniken-Centrum-Jean-Pierre-Andrevon/dp/3770432541) could only find german and french issues but maybe there's a translation. Also a bit short, but I like it.
- [Battle Angel Alita aka. Gunnm](https://myanimelist.net/manga/768/Gunnm) Does Manga count? This one's pretty good and also long. Love the scenario.
- [Ghost in the Shell](https://myanimelist.net/manga/1023/Koukaku_Kidoutai__The_Ghost_in_the_Shell) Haven't read it but the ratings are not bad and since the movies are based on it.

2: None of these are 100% cyberpunk, but they incorporate some elements:

Lazarus - no neon lights or hacking, but a cool low life high tech dystopian that's regressed to a feudal system. Also super soldiers with swords

Copperhead - does space western count as cyberpunk?

Descender - robots, cyborgs, civilization on the brink of collapse etc.

> Trawling through the web I came upon this little gem from CBR: [The Best Cyberpunk Comics Ever](https://www.cbr.com/the-best-cyberpunk-comics-ever/) and thought it worth the share.
>
> Note: the author points out at the beginning that Manga is excepted, as are the Neuromancer and Blade Runner adaptations, so that frees the field a little. Take a look and enjoy! Feel free to discuss, there were a few in there I’d never even heard of.

- 9/15: EMPTY ZONE
- 8/15: JUDGE DREDD: MEGA-CITY 2
- 7/15: THE PRIVATE EYE
- 6/15: 2020 VISIONS
- 5/15: 100%

7: *Transmetropolitan*.

"Sorry, no. I'm married, not hungry, infected with seven unknown diseases, gay, pregnant with lizards and clinically dead."

> 2: This - highly recommend Transmet, it's completely off the hook cyberpunk/transhumanist, the art is amazing, couldn't recommend more.

4: Ghost in the shell, Akira

2: Silent Dragon basically a yakuza revenge story in a cyberpunk setting

1: People have already said GiTS and Akira, so I'll second those and also recommend; Blame! *Origin Judge Dredd* A lot of Masamune Shirow's other work

---

10: *transmetropolitan*

> 1: I can't get enough of Blame! have you got more recommendations for similar things?

2: *Trasmetropolitan*, *Hard Boiled*, Ronin, Akira, Battle Angel Alita, *Tokyo Ghost*,

2: I think this is the third time this last two weeks that I've had to recommend our wiki.

Check it out here, its a really comprehensive list, enjoy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/wiki/comicbooks

---

18: [*Transmetropolitan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan).

You'll thank me after you've read it :-P

4: *Hard Boiled* by Frank Miller

3: If you liked Ghost in the Shell try Appleseed, and if you like your post-apocalyptic cyberpunk with a little more humor (and a lot more gene-altered cat-girls) try Dominion.

2: Ghost in the Shell...and it is not cyberpunk specifically but "Incal" by Moebius is the bible of graphic novels.

2: *Tokyo Ghost*

2: [The Outrunners](http://www.outrunnerscomic.com/Page-0) An ongoing web comic with an accompanying soundtrack.

1: It's short and still ongoing, but [Drugs & Wires](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/dnwcomic/clean-and-sober-living/) is pretty great alt-90s Soviet Bloc cyberpunk. Highly recommend it.

1: It's a little more sci-fi focused, but Trees by Warren Ellis and Jason Howard has a great setting with some awesome cyberpunk vibes in the first issue. I haven't been able to pick up a copy of the second issue, but I certainly intend to.

---

15: Ghost in the Shell.

11: Does *Tokyo Ghost* fit the bill? I pick that if it does.

10: *Judge Dredd*.

> 2: I'd also suggest the Eagle comics run from 83. That was my first intro to him. For what it's worth [here](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5944097/top-11-essential-judge-dredd-stories) is a pretty good article laying out some of his best story lines.

Warren Ellis writes quite of stuff that would be considered cyberpunk and biopunk.

6: *Hard Boiled* by Frank Miller. An oldie but a goodie. Has a ton of gore and sexual content just fyi.

> 3: Underrated. One of Miller's best.

5: I'd suggest Ghost Rider 2099, if you can find it.

5: the original spider-man 2099 and fray are good

2: Frank Millers Ronin fits the bill id say.

1: [Old City Blues](http://ocb.milonogiannis.com/)

## Best authors

### Ed Brubaker

Criminal is one of my favorite sagas in comics and everything he and Sean Phillips have done together I’ve loved, especially *The Fade Out*. Top notch stuff.

Others have mentioned this, but he's really mastered mystery writing. If you've ever picked up his singles and read the backmatter, you can see why. He's always checking out the classics whether it's novels, film, or comics.

I love crime stories and his takes have never disappointed, but he also has some fun superhero tales mixed in. Criminal, Fatale, Incognito, X-Men.

Ed Brubaker - Fatale, Incognito, Kill or Be Killed, *Fade Out* etc.

Everything he's done with Sean Phillips is amazing.

### Warren Ellis

Does high concept stuff really well similar to Morrison, but tackles more modern subject matter. Most notably technology. He also writes “realistic” superheroes the best.

Able to write in so many different styles. Usually is able to insert his sense of occasionally juvenile humor. A bit of a futurist with nostalgia for certain things past, it's always interesting to see where he thinks we might be headed.

His work makes me scared to be in his head. I love that he is never afraid to try anything good or bad. Transmetropliton, Global Frequency, Plantary, Authority, Black Summer, The Wild Storm.

One of comics' best thinkers. Not always the best execution but certainly aiming higher than most out there.

His imaginative and creativity is awesome.

My go-to for a fix of out-there science fiction concepts and ascerbic social and political commentary.

### Jonathan Hickman

A world-builder extroardinaire with a flair for long-game storytelling and a wicked sense of humour. 

He can make complex stories a breeze. 

A long form story telling god, East of West and his Secret Wars saga speak for themselves in this regard. favorite work- East of West

His Avengers/New Avengers saga, concluded in Secret Wars is one of my favorite epics of the medium. Beyond that his indie work is similarly incredible.

### Jeff Lemire

I feel like Lemire is someone who can just do it all. Doesn't matter what genre it is, or if it's even a genre work at all. He can tell a story about two people sitting in a room and it's as interesting as anything. He's great at making his characters feel very human and real, no matter what the situation around them is.

This guy has an amazing ability to tug on your heartstrings. Damn good artist, too.

He is an amazing writer. he knows how to tug at heartstrings and really make you feel for characters. the king of melancholy writing. favorite work- Black Hammer.

His ability to bring something new to established heroes as well as create compelling original stories and characters is very impressive. Moon Knight, Animal Man and Justice League Dark are all fresh and interesting takes and Black Hammer and Sweet Tooth are both incredible stand alone series.

### Frank Miller

He reinvented Batman with **The Dark Knight Returns** and **Year One**, but his work on Daredevil saved the character and turned him into a heartbeat of the Marvel Universe. I love his dialogue and ability to put a Eastwood quote into any situation. He coveys underlying sadness and guilt effortlessly. Both *Daredevil* runs, Just Dark Knight Returns And Year One, 300, Sun City, Ronin.

He's a legend. Like Alan Moore, he is undoubtedly one of the GOATs. Looking past his incredible (and much celebrated) Batman work and Sin City, his four issue Wolverine story is a personal favorite.

### Alan Moore

What's there to really say? Probably the greatest comic writer of all time. Has a thorough understanding of the history of not only the characters he's writing, but literature in general. And is able to weave an incredible amount of ideas in to the smallest amount of details in a panel.

First comic I read was Watchmen, I was pretty young maybe 13. Didn't fully get it at the time, but loved the scope, characters and style of storytelling. It was one of the first times in my life I read a book because I enjoyed it. I've read much of his work and have seriously enjoyed virtually every one.

Because he takes comics to another level of depth, creativity and realism. He exemplifies taking the medium to another level. **Watchmen**, Miracleman, *V for Vendetta*, Supreme, **Swamp Thing** and **From Hell** are some of the best ever done.

Has a knack for real thematic depth and insight into human nature with a ton of great quotes while still writing stories that are entertaining even just from a relatively shallow perspective.

> Best story arcs-Watchmen, Killing Joke, The Floronic Man arc of Swamp Thing

The best there is. Comics would be completely different without him. No one has had a bigger impact since the 80s.

What can I say that hasn’t already been said? great writer

### Grant Morrison

Like Moore, has a great understanding of the characters he's writing, and knowledge beyond just the comic format. While Moore is generally more subtle in his approach to getting ideas across, Morrison takes the wildest route imaginable. It's usually bombastic and weird, yet always in homage to those that came before him.

I think he’s the greatest writer in the medium’s history. He can do really high concept stuff like The Invisibles or Final Crisis better than anyone.

He makes me think harder than any other writer.

The writer who got me into comics, his Batman is my favorite run and his Vertigo work are some of the best written comics.

Great at high-concept, out-of-this world storytelling. Love his take on superheroes and superhumanity as allegories for humanity striving to be the best possible version of itself, and I dig the generally optimistic worldview many of his stories promote (Even his darker stories have a hopeful undertone to them).

Don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said better by other people but his way of making super stories feel fresh while also very true to their roots is basically unmatched

> He's very similar in writing style to Kojima, with heavy emphasis on metaphysics and meta textual references as well as allusions intended to make you question what is real and pushing the boundaries of what the medium can accomplish.

### Rick Remender

His work tends to feel extremely personal in a way that I don't really see from anyone else. Which isn't to say no one else's work *is* personal to them, but Remender just writes in a way that really shows it. You can easily see what the real-world themes behind the stories are, and it's always very human. It leaves me thinking not only about the specific stories he tells and the characters within them, but how the greater ideas apply to me and my own life. Obviously that's all subjective, and the themes he tends to explore are often relevant to me in the first place.

Rick Remender- amazing story teller, often has unlikeable characters at first you learn to feel for. defiantly the most depressed writer on my list. favorite work- Deadly Class.

> Haven’t heard much about Remender. What works do you recommend? - Mostly his Image books, they're some of my favorite comics, period. The best ones, in my opinion, are LOW, Tokyo Ghost, Black Science, Fear Agent, Deadly Class, Seven to Eternity, and Death or Glory.

Creates these nothing characters and then twists and drags them through Hell without a possibility of relief. Deadly Class, Black Science, Fear Agent, X-Force and Low are inventive and fresh.

### Greg Rucka

Rucka is the one on this list who I've been a fan of the longest. His first Wonder Woman run way back is one of my favorite DC stories of all time, and his current books at Image are some of my favorites. He definitely has a type of character that his books tend to focus on, but I'm a fan of his style.

Love his Wonder Woman, Batman, Gotham Central, and others; I've liked the vast majority of his work that I've read.

Creates worlds that feel relatable. His characters have a weight to them-you can feel them. He would be here just for Lazarus, but Gotham Central, The Old Guard, Wonder Woman, Black Magic are all great stories...just noticed the strong female lead connection.

Very similar reason to Brubaker with crime and spy stories, but Lazarus its self is a thing of beauty. Stumptown, Queen & Country, Veil, The Question, Wonder Woman.

### Scott Snyder

While I like a good portion of his DC work, his Vertigo and Image stuff is where he really shines in my opinion. The Wake, while not often talked about, is a favorite of mine. I'd love to see more Wytches and American Vampire. Hopefully Undiscovered Country doesn't end up in a similar situation.

Batman is my favorite superhero. His Batman work is some of my favorite, from Black Mirror through New 52 Batman and his newer stuff like All-Star Batman, its one of the great runs on a character.

Have only really read his Batman, but Snyder is a jack of all trades. He expertly balances plot, character development, emotion, blockbuster action, big speeches and horror. He always aims high and never phones in a story arc.

> Best Story Arcs-Court Of Owls, Zero Year.

### Brian K. Vaughan

Between **Saga**, *Y: The Last Man*, and Paper girls, BKV is just *fun*. He has a great sense for balancing light, fun character stuff that makes you like his characters with the more serious, emotional stuff to get the best payoff possible when things start to go bad.

**Saga** is the best comic series ever, imo. Serious credit also goes to Fiona Staples, but combined with Y and The Oath (Dr. Strange), he's one of my go tos.

### Mark Waid

Somewhat similar to Tomasi in terms of writing very human empathetic character driven stories. However, they have different strong suits. Mark Waid is better at having a character arc over the course of a larger story arc, but his individual emotional scene's don't work quite as well as Tomasi's. Also, his runs tend to have a lot of filler arcs without much character development (especially Flash and Daredevil). I like how he's optimistic, but isn't afraid to show his characters as flawed without making them anti heroes. 

> Best story arcs-Superman Birthright, The Return Of Barry Allen, most of his Fantastic Four run.

I think he's the best pure super hero writer it there. No matter the character he does great entertaining work. Daredevil, FF, Spidey are all amazing and he seems to be able to bring the most out of every hero.

### Honorable mentions

Jason Aaron: Great with heroes like Waid, especially Thor obviously, but also able to do good indie stuff. I feel like he's always solid no matter the book.

Jeffrey Brown - his early autobio stuff is still my favourite thing in comics.

Kurt Busiek, Mark Waid, Alan Davis, Roger Stern, Roy Thomas. Because they have written some of the best runs of all time, because they love superheroes, because they don't wish to deconstruct or decompress or derange or de anything, and because their work is smart, and most importantly, fun.

> Kurt Busiek: Astro City and *Conan*. Both great reads.

Mike Carey - There aren't many other writers out there who can better handle an epic fantasy comic. Mike Carey - Hellblazer, Lucifer, X-men.

Chris Claremont - His X-men magnum opus. His X-Men runs, even when weird are interesting. He developed the superhero team I never can seem to completely stop reading and his issues are favorites.

Peter David-makes me think about the psychology of the character more than anyone else. He is inventive and knows how to inject the kind of humor that make the Marvel movies work, but it is his deep characterization that makes him one of my favorites. Incredible Hulk and X-Factor.

Al Feldstein - brilliant writer, he wrote some of EC’s best stories and paved the way for geniuses like Moore.

Neil Gaiman - he writes stories and creates characters that drive my own imagination (**Sandman**). The most versatile writer I know.

Kieron Gillen - A never-ending fountain of creativity with an incredible grasp of how comicbooks function as a medium, ceaselessly coming up with new ways to use that grasp to push comic book storytelling into new avenues.

Geoff Johns - he knows how to bring wow moments in any comic he writes. Flash, **Green Lantern**.

Mike Mignola: One of the best short story crafters out there. Great sense of mood, pacing and humor. Very poetic.

Peter Milligan - as clever as Moore & Morrison, just check out *Enigma* to see why. His Hellblazer and X-Statix, X-Statix in particular is a great read. Also the Batman story Dark Night, Dark City.

Russel- I love his views on society. I dont always agree with them, but I enjoy them nonetheless. I mean the man got me to pull the Wonder Twins. The Flintstones, Lone Ranger, Prez, God is disappointed in you.

Jeff Smith - his characters, no matter how far fetched they are, seem real and relatable.

---

Best Batman runs: run by **Grant Morrison** (right before the New 52; Batman R.I.P. And Batman and Robin are both strong 10/10’s according to Reddit), **Hush** by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee, *New 52 run* by Scott Snyder (his run is pretty dark), old run by O'Neil and Adams.

> In general, when we talk about Batman, the best ones are comic books, which are short runs like **Batman: Year One**.
>
> [Batman - essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/essentials) is great recommendations. Also, you should use [Batman - reading order](https://www.comicbookherald.com/reading-dc-comics/batman-reading-order/#batman7). According to it:
>
> > III)[ Year One & The Modern Bat ***(Most New Readers Should Start Here!)***](https://www.comicbookherald.com/reading-dc-comics/batman-reading-order/#batman3)

Best Batman comic books: **Batman: Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Hush**, **Court of Owls**, **The Black Mirror**, *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*.

- Joker: **The Man Who Laughs**, **The Killing Joke**, **Death *of* the Family**, **Joker**, **Endgame**.

  > A Death **in** the Family is the post-crisis story, that I find terrible.
- Harley Quinn: ~~**Batman: Mad Love**~~.

Best Daredevil comics: **Daredevil** (1979-1983) by Frank Miller (**Born Again** is the best story arc), **The Man Without Fear** by Frank Miller, **Daredevil** (2000-2006) by Brian Michael Bendis (the greatest modern run of the character, Alex Maleev is the best artist of Daredevil), *Daredevil* (2006-2009) by Ed Brubaker, Daredevil (2011-2015) by Mark Waid, Daredevil (1986-1991) by Ann Nocenti (underrated run).
> Read **Man without Fear** first like others have suggested. Then, **Frank Miller's first run** is collected in 3 trades. After that, read **Born Again**.
>
> Any run of Daredevil can satisfy you. Story wise he might be the most consistent Marvel hero.

Best The Flash comics: 

- Wally West: *The Flash by Mark Waid* - best run!

- Barry Allen: *The Flash (2010-2011) Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues (The Flash: Rebirth series)*, *The Flash (2010-2011): The Road To Flashpoint (The Flash: Rebirth series Book 2)*, *Flashpoint*, New52 Flash, (DC Rebirth #1), Flash: Rebirth (2016) (*The Flash (2016-) Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*), and so forth. 

  > Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*
  >
  > New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Best Green Lantern comics: ~~*Green Lantern: Secret Origin*~~, *Green Lantern: Rebirth*, Blackest Night and other books in Geoff Johns's Green Lantern Saga, *The Green Lantern* (2018) by Grant Morrison (The Green Lantern Vol. 1: Intergalactic Lawman, The Green Lantern Vol. 2: The Day the Stars Fell).

> I think *The Green Lantern* (2018) by Grant Morrison is the best entry point in 2020 because it is new and short (while). Also, this run is chosen as the best DC series in 2019 according to Reddit:
>
> > Best DC Series: The Green Lantern (37.1% of the vote)

Best Hellboy comics: nearly all of it is written by Mike Mignola and nearly all of it is worth reading. Just start at the beginning with [Hellboy, Volume 1: *Seed of Destruction*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593070942) and follow the rest in [suggested reading order](http://www.multiversitycomics.com/annotations/hellboy-reading-order-2019/) (*Conqueror Worm* is the best story arc among them). Although, the best option would be to buy omnibuses. *Plague of Frogs* BPRD run is also recommended by people. Besides this spin-off, people also recommend these books: *Frankenstein Underground*, *Lobster Johnson*.

Best Hulk comics: **Incredible Hulk Visionaries** (80s-90s) by Peter Devid (the best run), **Planet Hulk** and **World War Hulk** by Greg Pak, *Hulk the End* by Peter David (depressing af though), *Immortal Hulk* by Al Ewing, Incredible Hulk (1999-2007) by Bruce Jones, Hulk: Gray by Jeph Loeb, Ultimate Hulk Vs Wolverine by Damon Lindelof.

> *Immortal Hulk* by Al Ewing (and its story arc) is chosen as the best Ongoing series in 2019 according to Reddit:

> > Best Ongoing Series: The Immortal Hulk (49.1% of the vote)
> > Best Story Arc: Hulk In Hell (37.5% of the vote)

Best Spider-Man comics: **Ultimate Spider-Man** by Brian Bendis, *Kraven's Last Hunt* and *The Death of Gwen Stacey* are the best comics of classic era (*Amazing Spider-Man*, the Bible of the Spider-Man universe), *Spider-Man Blue* by Jeph Loeb, Origin of the Hobgoblin+Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut+The Kid Who Collected Spider-Man by Roger Stern, Spider-Man: Birth of Venom, Spider-Man: Spider-Island, The Death of Jean DeWolff and One Small Break are both very good "dark" stories, Spider-Man/Human Torch (modern and light-hearted story).

> **Ultimate Spider-Man** is going to be the most accessible by a wide margin.
>
> *Amazing Spider-Man* from the beginning is the founder, and it *is* good, but its influence may exceed its readability to you.
>
> Everything else is secondary. Seriously, *everything*.

- Miles Morales: origin starts in All-New Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1 (Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man Omnibus collects the whole Ultimate run), his original run Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man (second volume) is really strong.

- Spider-Gwen: the first two volumes worth (Vol. 0 and Vol. 1) are really great (after reading the comments, I would say it's not worth it to read it - it is hit or miss).

  > Actually, people write that they're not worth reading: "None of them are very good. He’s just a tool to get even more money, without putting forth any original ideas. Same thing with all of the other spider-verse characters and spin-offs in the last 10 years. Remember, this IS from the same people who went through with OMD." - this was wr itten about Morales. I guess same can be applied to Spider-Gwen.

Best Suicide Squad comics: **Suicide Squad** (1987) by John Ostrander and Kim Yale, the current *Suicide Squad* run by Tom Taylor, Secret Six by Gail Simone (for the the Deadshot), the Deadshot: Beginnings miniseries by John Ostrander and Kim Yale (read after Suicide Squad (1987) #18). 

> Plus, [people say](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/grt0wb/current_runs/) that Suicide Squad (2019) by Tom Taylor is one of the best DC runs at the moment.

Best Swamp Thing comics: **Saga of the Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore, *New 52 Swamp Thing* by *Scott Snyder*.

Best Wonder Woman comics: *Wonder Woman by George Perez Omnibus Vol. 1*, *Wonder Woman By George Perez Omnibus Vol. 2*, *Wonder Woman by George Perez Omnibus Vol. 3*, *Wonder Woman By Greg Rucka Vol. 1* (Rucka's first run), *Wonder Woman by Greg Rucka, Vol. 2* (Rucka's first run), *Wonder Woman Vol. 1: The Lies (Rebirth)* (Rucka is back, it's his second run, and it's good starting point).

Best X-Men comics: **Uncanny X-Men** by Chris Claremont (classic and best; **X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga** is the most frequently mentioned), *New X-Men* by Grant Morrison, *Astonishing X-Men* by Joss Whedon (Swap this with New X-Men for a more consistent/fun intro to X-Men), House of M by Brian Michael Bendis, Uncanny X-Force Vol. 1 by Rick Remender (maybe it's as cool as Wheadon and Morrison comics), Dawn of X and House Of X/powers Of X Jonathan Hickman.

> Dawn of X is the best X-men run to jump in in 2020. House Of X/powers Of X by Jonathan Hickman is the best Marvel series in 2019 according to Reddit:
>
> > Best Limited Series: House of X/Powers of X (52.2% of the vote)
> > Best Event/Crossover: House of X/Powers of X (79% of the vote)
> > Best Single Issue: House of X #2 (39.5% of the vote)
> > Best Marvel Series: House of X/Powers of X (40% of the vote)

- Cyclops: *New X-Men* by Grant Morrison, *Astonishing X-Men* by Joss Whedon (he is a badass in this one), Kieron Gillen's Uncanny X-Men run (#534.1-544, #1-20) and Avengers vs X-Men: Consequences, Messiah Complex by Ed Brubaker, X-Men: Second Coming by Mike Carey, Marvel comics presents: Cyclops.

- Gambit: **Uncanny X-Men** by Chris Claremont (#246, #265-280), X-23 by Marjorie Liu, Gambit (2012) by James Asmus, Rogue & Gambit by Kelly Thompson, X-Men: Gambit & Rogue by Howard Mackie, Gambit Classic by Howard Mackie.

- Wolverine: **Wolverine (1982)** by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, **Weapon X - Marvel Comics Presents (1988)** by Barry Windsor-Smith, **Enemy of the State - Wolverine (2003)** by Mark Millar, *Wolverine: Get Mystique* by Jason Aaron, *Adamantium Men - Wolverine Weapon X (2009)* by Jason Aaron (the entire Wolverine Weapon X by Jason Aaron isn't bad), *Wolverine Goes to Hell - Wolverine (2010)* by Jason Aaron (the whole Wolverine (2010-2012) run isn't bad, but GtH is the best comic in it), *Wolverine: Old Man Logan (2008-2009)* by Mark Millar (someone says that Lemire's run is better), Wolverine Epic Collection: Madripoor Nights, Wolverine by Greg Rucka Ultimate Collection (+Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender, All-New Wolverine, **X-Men: Dark Phoenix Saga Complete Collection**).

  > Wolverine is one where you should just read the good stuff - not the entire runs. BUT! You can read the whole [2003 run](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JHX4VV4?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf) of Wolverine, starting with the Greg Rucka run from issues #1-19 and continue to the amazing **Enemy of the State**/Agent of Shield run by the man Mark Millar all the way to Old Man Logan.

---

Best Alien comics: **Aliens: Outbreak**, **Aliens: Nightmare Asylum**, **Aliens: Female War** (it is better to buy Aliens Omnibus Volume 1 to get all three of them), *Aliens Vs. Predator*, *Labyrinth*, *Music of the Spears*, *Aliens: Defiance*, Aliens: Dead Orbit, ~~Aliens: Salvation~~.

> A lot of of the Aliens comics are surprisingly good.

Best Blade Runner comics: Blade Runner 2019 by Michael Green.

> Blade Runner 2019 by Michael Green is the best Comic Adaptation of Another Medium in 2019 according Reddit:
>
> > Best Comic Adaptation of Another Medium: Blade Runner 2019 (80.4% of the vote)

Best Doctor Who comics:

- **TITAN COMICS**: *Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Vol. 2: The Weeping Angels of Mons* (or Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Complete Year 1 Vol. 1), *Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor Vol. 1-6* (the first two years of [Eleventh Doctor](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Who%3A_The_Eleventh_Doctor)), *3 Volume 1: The Heralds of Destruction*, *9 Volume 1: Weapons of Past Destruction* (+-), *4 Volume 1: Gaze of the Medusa* (+- mediocre plot), *8 Volume 1: A Matter of Life and Death* (+- wishy-washy).

  > Personally, the Titan stuff is fairly easy to find and digest, and is split up pretty well. While artwork in Titan comics can sometimes be wonky as hell (I don't think anyone has been able to do a good Eleventh Doctor from what I've read so far), the stories are mostly good. 

- **DOCTOR WHO MAGAZINE (Marvel/Panini):** *5 Complete: The Tides of Time*, *6 Volume 1: Voyager*, *6 Volume 2: The World Shapers*, entire *8th Doctor's run*, *10 Volume 3: The Crimson Hand*, entire *11th Doctor's run*.

  > The Panini stuff has some great artwork, but it can be a bit dense, and it's more expensive than the Titan stuff, generally. And they have a natural advantage - a much closer connection to the BBC.

- **IDW**: *1-10 Special: The Forgotten*, *1-11 Special: Prisoners of Time*. Just for fun: [Star Trek: The Next Generation / Doctor Who: Assimilation 2: The Complete Series](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Assimilation-Complete/dp/1613777825/) - crossover of Eleventh Doctor and The Next Generation crew of Star Trek.

  >IDW is the worst among those publishers.

Best Godzilla comics: *Godzilla: The Half-Century War*, *Godzilla: Rulers of Earth*, *Godzilla: Cataclysm*, Godzilla in Hell (+- Godzilla: Gangsters & Goliaths, Godzilla: Legends).

Best Judge Dredd comics: *Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files #5*, *Origins*, *America*, (+*Complete Case Files #1*, *Complete Case Files #14*).

Best Rick and Morty comics: the entire main run.

Best Silent Hill comics: *Past Life* and *Downpour: Anne's Story* are very good, but the others are really bad.

Best Star Trek comics: *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*, others are not great tbh.

Best Star Wars comics: 

- Legends: *Knights of the Old Republic*.
- Canon: *Darth Vader*, *Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith* (it looks like it's the best SW comics).

Best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics: *the current IDW* is the best starting point (~~1st book~~), *City at War* (Mirage v1 #50-62) is widely viewed as the best TMNT run, *City Fall* (IDW 21-28 - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The IDW Collection Volume 3 (TMNT IDW Collection) I guess) was incredibly good as well.

Best The Witcher comics: they're awful (stories give nothing to the universe, art could be ugly), but if you still want to read them, then The Witcher, Vol. 1: House of Glass is the best according to Goodreads (3.87 for 2,888 ratings). The next comic books are equal in terms of quality: The Witcher, Vol. 2: Fox Children (story is better than the third one) and The Witcher, Vol. 3: Curse of Crows (story is worse but it has Ciri). Notice, that the third volume has a different art style.

---

Best comics by genre:

- Fantasy: **Sandman**, *Fables*, **Saga**, **Bone**, *Monstress*, *Rat Queens*, *Conan*, *The Autumnlands*, *Black Magick* by Greg Rucka, *Locke & Key*, East of West by Jonathan Hickman, Birthright, Seven to Eternity by Rick Remender, Girl Genius (Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank - #1), Head Lopper, Ravine, *Hellboy*, The Hedge Knight by George Martin, official Pathfinder comics (especially the Origins series), official DnD comics (especially Fell's Five), Order of the Stick, Critical Role: Vox Machina, (+ Berserk manga).
