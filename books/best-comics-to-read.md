## Various answers

> **Bold** - means a name that people mention a lot.
>
> *Italic* - means a name that people mention a lot, but not as often as **Bold**.

I'm not a fan of this sentiment at all, I don't think anyone gets to decide what makes someone a "true" fan of something and I especially wouldn't say someone wasn't a true fan for not having read books like Age of Ultron and Civil War, highly flawed as they are.

That aside, my favorites that I recommend to everybody:

- **Saga of the Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore & Steve Bisette
- **Planetary** by Warren Ellis & John Cassaday
- Chew by John Layman & Rob Guillory
- **Bone** by Jeff Smith
- Stray Bullets by David Lapham

There can’t really be a MUST read list, because comics appeal to many different audiences for many different reasons.

The best examples of the medium to me are:

1. **Watchmen** is the best example of the possibilities of the medium.
2. **Maus** is memoir and metaphor done to perfection.
3. **From Hell** is literature.
4. **The Dark Knight Returns** is cinema done as a comic, blending perfect imagery to story. 
5. *Daredevil Born Again* is the greatest exploration of who a character is ever executed.

Someone:

> I like this answer because it recognizes that "true comic book fan" should probably include the entire medium and not just one (dominant) genre/region.

---

I can say, Civil War and Age of Ultron, would not be on many lists.

But top 5 I would recommend:

1. A Contract With God
2. **Sandman**
3. Astro City
4. Little Nemo
5. Calvin and Hobbes

---

**STANDALONE STORIES**

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Kingdom Come**
3. Infinity Gauntlet
4. **The Dark Knight Returns**
5. Kraven's Last Hunt

**COMPLETE RUNS**

1. *Daredevil* by Frank Miller
2. **Green Lantern** by Geoff Johns

   > Geoff Johns' entire 9 year run on GL. I don't think anyone can read that entire run without becoming a huge GL fan by the end of it.
3. **Swamp Thing** by Alan Moore
4. Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman
5. Ultimate Spider-Man (Peter Parker) by Brian Michael Bendis

**CURRENT BOOKS**

1. Immortal Hulk by Al Ewing
2. Venom by Donny Cates
3. The Green Lantern by Grant Morrison
4. Your Choice of Amazing Spider-Man by Nick Spencer or Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man by Tom Taylor
5. [reserve spot for Jonathan Hickman's House of X and Powers of X and whatever X-Men stuff of his comes next]

---

2: **Watchmen**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, The Dark Phoenix Saga, **Kingdom Come**, and Kraven’s Last Hunt.

2: Preacher, **Batman: Killing Joke**, Spider Man: Maximum Carnage, **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, XMen: Days of Future Past.

2: **Watchmen**, **Kingdom Come**, *Judge Dredd: America*, **The Dark Knight Returns**.

> Judge Dredd america is amazing. Judge Dredd year one is some decent fun.
>
> The problem with cherrypicking Dredd is that the later, longer storylines (that is, the multi-part stories, as *Judge Dredd* is published in serial instalments of eight-or so pages in *2000AD* weekly) are grounded in the world gradually introduced in the earlier self-contained strips. One naturally precedes the other. You could just jump into the *Robot Wars* or *The Cursed Earth* and read them, but while they don't rely on the details of Dredd and his world offered previously, they are augmented by it.
>
> Later stories, such as the classic *America* and *Democracy Now!*, work better by being read in their context - that is, Dredd starting as a sci-fi satire on the Dirty Harry-style antihero, then becoming a popular character for its own sake, and then the writers realizing the need to remind the readers that Dredd, and the entire Judge system, is fascist. That gradual drip-feed of information, text and subtext, is what makes Dredd a truly satisfying epic, forty years old and still going strong.
>
> America is a good introduction, other than the Case Files. It is fantastic. Of course, I may be somewhat biased because that is the only Dredd I have read. However as Hugo said (two big paragraphs above), from what I've heard Dredd, it is best to read most stuff in order.

In no particular order:

- Scott Pilgrim (Brian Lee O’Malley)
- The Vision (Tom King, Gabriel Walta, & Jordie Bellaire)
- Black Hole (Charles Burns) # really hard
- **Watchmen** (Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons)
- **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman & Everyone)
- **Bone** (Jeff Smith)
- Blankets (Craig Thompson)
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Bagley, Stuart Immonen, David LaFuente, & Sara Pichelli)
- Astonishing X-Men (Joss Whedon & John Cassaday)
- **Batman: The Long Halloween** (Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale)
  "+" in other answer: **Kingdom Come** - Even if you don't regularly read their comics, you will know a lot of characters and the art is fantastic.

---

1. **Watchmen**
2. **Sandman**
3. **Planetary**
4. **Saga**
5. Marvels
6. **Kingdom Come**
7. DC: The new frontier
8. Gotham Central
9. Superior foes of Spider-Man
10. Morrison's Animal man

> Where do you suggest to start with marvel? - By Marvels, I assume he means the (excellent) series by Kurt Busiek and and Alex Ross, not the entire Marvel Universe. That would be a tad excessive as a recommendation.

---

James Robinson - *Starman*

Alan Moore - **Saga of the Swamp Thing** # one guy mentioned this in the top and get many votes

Neil Gaiman - **Sandman**

Mark Waid - **Kingdom Come**

Jeff Smith - **Bone**

Warren Ellis - **Planetary** # there were many mentions on Reddit

Dave Sim - Cerebus (up to about issue 150 - there's good stuff after that but only the first half is *essential*)

Brian Michael Bendis - Ultimate Spider-Man

David Lapham - Stray Bullets

John Layman - Chew

> Fuck, I forgot Starman! I have to change my list, shit. Good call.

---

1. All-Star Superman : This is a story that can make even the biggest Superman detractors fall in love with the guy. This is the quintessential Superhero story.
2. **Kingdom Come** : This is an epic. Alex Ross' art gives it the same feel, and it almost feels like mythology. It's amazing.
3. Final crisis : The best of all the crisis, Morrison does something so amazing that I can't even decipher it in a single read. It's the ultimate story, and it reflects why Superman is the greatest superhero.
4. Infinite Crisis : Another Crisis. This shows that we don't need darkness to create good stories. Stories don't need to be dark and edgy for the sake of it. You know what's better than one Superman? Two of them.
5. Geoff Johns' **Green Lantern** : This man brought the GL franchise from zero. He built on the legacy that was left by his previous writers and left it at a level that I don't think any other human can. Such innovation, and so many incredible ideas.

## Even more opinions

143: I really liked the graphic novel **Bone** it had a really interesting story about each character, especially the old humans. It incorporated humor and drama that got me wondering about life in like fifth grade. And of course the Adventures of Tintin.

> Bone is fantastic, even for adults. It is very simple, but absolutely fantastic.

133: Calvin and Hobbes. I understand it is a comic strip and doesnt directly answer your question, but I love the strip and I am counting it.

> Yeah, it's just a charming and funny comic. Love it. I work in a thrift store and the books of the strips come in some times and I make sure to under-price them insanely so someone can have an awesome find.

115: **Saga**. It's a gloriously over-the-top space opera by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples. Violence, adult themes, heart and humour all wrapped up into one longrunning package.

> Also from Vaughn, Y the Last Man, a semi-long running but totally finished work of speculative fiction. Its the story of a man name Yorick and his monkey and they try to make their way through a world following the mysterious death of everyone but them with a Y chromosome.

105:

- [**Sandman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)) - Pretty much the whole series is good,.

- [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(comics)) Start off the the "Hunter Rose Omnibus" for Grendel. Look into the others before buying. Not all of them are as good. 

- Finally, [Cerebus The Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Read it all if you can, from start to finish. It'll take a while, but it's a fucking masterpiece of literature, not just comic books.

  > WARNING ABOUT CERBERUS
  >
  > At one point the creator gets dumped and the book mutates into a weird misogynist screed with page upon page of text and doodles masquerading as a comic.

> I would add: Planetary, and The Authority.

68: All-Star Superman.

> Legit one of the best comic books ever made imo and probably the best Superman story.

51: **Maus** by Art Spiegelman. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/08/11/why-maus-remains-the-greatest-graphic-novel-ever-written-30-years-later/?utm_term=.5e7c7f42833a

51: Scott Pilgrim (all of them)

44: [Old Man Logan](https://youtu.be/cNAD0fTBn2I)

> You want the one (tom) written by Mark Millar.

44: *Preacher*. The show doesn't even compare to how well made the comic is.

> The characters are great. Its the directing they're trying to pace themselves and build up plot but its so damn boring and feels like filler. Why are they using the love triangle arc?? Cassidy was never "in love" with Tulip like in the show. I can tell they're building to where they fight over her and its gonna suck. I wanted the second Season to be about them going to New York and THEN being kidnapped by the L'angels. Sorry long reply.

44: The 2012 run of *Hawkeye* by Matt Fraction. It’s a slow, almost noir-like story about Hawkeye’s everyday life as a single guy in New York who is also a superhero. It’s really brilliant.

24: 
Complete: 

- *Fables* - Fairy tale people live in NY. Eventually there's a big war with their home world.

  > The first arc of Fables dealing with the adversary was great, but it lost steam after that. The first four chapters are still one of my favourite comic arcs.

- **Watchmen** - I thought it was just okay, but the overall consensus is that it's amazing. Realistic super hero story that flips tropes.

- Y: The Last Man - All but let's say one man dies. The world handles that pretty poorly.

- and maybe The Boys - Super heroes are real, but they're more like celebrities. Also they're terrible people deserving of death.

  > For me The Boys swings between trying to catch my breath from laughter, and putting it down and looking for videos of kittens to try and block out the awful.

Still running:

- **Saga** - Do you like a colorful world filled with action and sex? Then you'll love saga.

- The Walking Dead - The pretty good zombie comic that inspired the shitty show. Lulls after the prison, lulls again after All Out War.

  > It's actually completed.

Bonus:

> Finally someone mentions *Transmetropolitan*. It's all the way up there with Sandman and Watchmen for me.
>
> > I'd rate it better than Watchmen, almost as good as The Boys which is  one of my all time favourites.

38: "From hell" by Alan Moore. Revolves around the mystery of Jack the ripper. With insight to lot of conspiracy theories and postulations. Everything in the book is meticulously detailed and researched, down right the weather of the particular scene. It's extensive and an achievement in the medium. For me from hell represents the maximum potential of the graphic novel as a medium.

27:

- Jimmy Corrigan by Chris Ware
- Love and Rockets by Los Bros Hernandez
- **Maus** by Art Spiegelman
- The Complete Crumb by R. Crumb
- American Splendor by Harvey Pekar
- **Watchmen**, V for Vendetta and **From Hell** by Alan Moore (and Dave Gibbons, David Lloyd and Eddie Campbell)
- Eightball by Daniel Clowes
- Krazy Kat by George Herriman
- A Contract with God by Will Eisner
- **Sandman** by Neil Gaiman and various artists

That was the best I could think of off the top of my head. I'll probably kick myself later for not thinking of others.

Edit: Dammit. I knew I would:

- Prophet by Brandon Graham and Simon Roy
- Black Hole by Charles Burns
- Lone Wolf & Cub by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima
- Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson
- Corpse on the Imjin and Other Stories by Harvey Kurtzman
- Palestine by Joe Sacco
- Tales from the Crypt by Various

> Yeah this is probably the most complete one on the thread. I would add Frank by Jim Woodring, Preacher by Garth Ennis, Peanuts by Charles Schulz, and Fun Home by Alison Bechdel.

21: 

- **Watchmen**

- **Maus**

- **Persopolis**

  > The Persepolis graphic novel goes more in depth than the film, but otherwise is mostly the same

I’d have to add Dark Knight Returns but it has no where near the critical acclaim or mainstream, general recognition of the other three.

> Dark Knight Returns is Frank Miller’s version of an old, embittered Batman. I don’t think Nolan took anything interesting from this version, personally. I love this comic though, I have a hard time deciding if DKR or Watchmen is ‘better’.
>
> This is the book that transformed Batman from the old comedy tv show to the much darker batman we're used to nowadays. It's pretty political though, at least one friend I lent it to didn't like it because he didn't agree with the political statements.

## Bonus answer - the only mention of Transmetropolitan

5: Top Ten by Alan Moore. It's a very non-Alan-Moore-like comic. Fun, entertaining and bright. It's yet another take on his usual schtick ("what if superheroes really existed in the real world") but it's done with a sense of fun and the end result is a great comic book.

4: *Transmetropolitan*, Astro City, and Ultimate Spider-Man.

> Ultimate Spider-Man is probably one of my favorite continuous superhero runs.

3: It depends on what they are looking for. For those who want something outside the realm of Superheroes usually Essex County. For those who want Superhero stories but done in a different way All Star Superman, and for those who just want a great starting point to get into comics usually Ultimate Spider-Man.

## Best Batman comics to read

> [Batman - essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/essentials) on Reddit.

---

21: If you like a dark story with a twist, try **The Long Halloween** and its sequel, **Dark Victory**.

11: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory** (sequel to TLH), Hush, Under The Red Hood, Black Mirror, and **The Court of Owls**.

> Someone: I really enjoyed Zero Year as a starting point. Year One is a different comics.

8: The right answer is always **The Court of Owls** (The New 52) for new readers. It's the perfect starting point.

> Court of Owls is pretty dark IMO. # analyzing the comments, I can tell you that's not exactly true.

---

For a starter I would say read Batman **Year One** or the **Killing Joke**. Basically the greats. After that it's pretty much a pick your own buffet. My personal favorites are no mans land (Batman helping Gotham in a huge earthquake) , **The Court of Owls** (new villians. As namesake) , the world's finest (Batman and Superman team up, its nothing like the movies )

> Watching or reading Batman: Year One first? - I'm biased due to Year One being one of my favorites, but I say read it first. Its not duper long, but it's fantastic. Just a warning though, it's just as much a Gordon story as a Batman one.

Edit: there was one comic or short that was damn good, it was about Batman's psyche and it ended with Batman in a sewer who could not let go of his guns.

I really recommend you to read it if anyone can help identify it.

---

6: Have a go at grant Morrison’s Arkham asylum and Alan Moore’s **the killing joke**. Both dark, and the art ok Arkham asylum is awesome.

> Edit: killing joke not man who laughs.
>
> Right after that, please, please, please read Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns.

5: Must reads are **Killing Joke** by Alan Moore and Hush by Jeph Loeb, both are extremely dark and the best batman books to date in my opinion. If you don't mind a Dick Grayson Batman, try Black Mirror as well, it is extremely dark.

4: **The Dark Knight Returns** is about a Batman who come out of retirement because Gotham’s gone to hell. He’s unleashed, uncappable of holding back. It’s absolutely amazing. Skip watching the animated movies until you’ve read the comic. It’s only four issues.

---

7: **The Court of Owls** is where I would start. It's modern and one of the best Batman stories ever. It's volume 1 of Scoot Snyder's Batman. If you like it, it runs for like 8 volumes.

You are going to get a lot of recommendations for **Year One** and **The Dark Knight Returns**. They are considered Batman classics, but IMO they don't hold up extremely well.

**The Long Halloween** is another one you can jump into without much knowledge of Batman. It's sequel is **Dark Victory**.

3: All New 52. **Killing Joke**. **Year One**. **The Dark Knight Returns**. Batman: The White Knight. Batman Hush. Batman The Black Mirror. Batman Death in the Family. Batman Under the Hood

2: **Batman Year One**. **The dark knight returns** **The long Halloween** **The killing joke** **Dark Victory** Grant Morrison’s Batman run Scott Snyder’s Batman Run

> EDIT: also Batman Earth One by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank.

## Best Comics about the Joker

*Comics:*

- **The Man Who Laughs**
- **The Killing Joke** (seems to be the most relevant to what the upcoming Joker film is going for)

(I haven’t read ”Death in the Family” yet, so I didn’t list it, but I heard it’s a classic. I also heard “**Death *of* the Family**” is very good, and there’s a DC Essential Edition of it coming up)

There’s also “The Three Jokers” coming up by Geoff Johns.

*Films:*

- Batman (1989)
- The Dark Knight (2008)
- Under the Red Hood (an animated film that revolves around the aftermath of “Death in the Family”)

*Video Games:*

- The Arkham Trilogy (even in Knight, the Joker plays a big role).

> Someone: 
>
> Joker by Azzarello is good.
>
> Death of the Family by Snyder and Capullo is probably my favorite.
>
> The last one is collected into a single volume that makes it easier to read for a guy who's not big into comics, as you said.

---

I loved Batman: White Knight personally - definitely recommend you read it. You may also like some of the New 52 stuff (**Death of The Family** is the one you hear most often but chronologically I'm not sure where it's placed).

> The New 52 is Death **of** the Family, which I agree is really good. A Death **in** the Family is the post-crisis story, that I find terrible. Just wanted to clear it up for OP.

### What is your favorite joker story?

You should probably add '*besides the Killing Joke*' because well obviously.

> Then the obvious answer would be "The Laughing Fish".

Endgame.

If I were to choose something besides **The Killing Joke** or "The Laughing Fish", it would be "Dreadful Birthday, Dear Joker".

After **The Killing Joke**, **The Man Who Laughs**.

### What is the DARKEST Joker story in the Batman comics?

20: If you don't think the Joker from Snyder and Capullo's New 52 run is dark and twisted enough, then I don't know what's wrong with you. That's the most sadistic version I've seen yet.

> Death of the Family and Endgame from New 52 focus on Joker, and they're both great.

> The entire Snyder New 52 run of Batman is fantastic.

20: **Death of the Family**, Endgame, **The Killing Joke**, Brian Azzarello's Joker, **The Man Who Laughs**.

8: Obvious answer is **The Killing Joke** but I think Brian Azzarello's 'Joker' graphic novel is even more unsettling, especially the scene with Frost's ex-wife.

> Joker by Brian Azzerello is fantastic.

### Joker Comic Reading List

My number 1 personal recommendation is **The Killing Joke** its widely considered to be one of the best joker stories out there and in my opinion is the best. It was the first comic book I read and what hooked me on the character so I may be biased in this regard but I really can't think of a better jumping off point for a new comic book reader in general or a new batman reader or just a new reader to the Joker. Writer Alan Moore gives a gripping and terrifying story focusing more on the Joker then Batman while also exploring one of the possible origin stories for the character all in all it's one of the best characterizations out there along with Brian Bollands beautiful artwork it becomes a must-read for Joker fans.( just make sure to get the deluxe edition which was published years later and includes updated coloring that improves the quality of the whole book even more most comic book shops will exclusively sell the deluxe edition so it shouldn't be a problem but just in case I should mention it if you're not experience with comics)

Next down from that is **Death Of The Family** ( not to be confused with death in the family which is the story of how Jason Todd the second Robin was murdered by the Joker it's an iconic story and undoubtedly an important event in Batman mythos however I personally am not fond of the overall storyline finding it a bit sloppy but feel free to check it out for yourself at your local library or read couple panels at a bookstore and decide) admittedly the new 52 provided a lot of controversial storylines that divided the fan base, however Scott Snyder set out to write a horror story set in the universe of Batman and did so expertly by putting him up against the Joker with the stakes higher than they've ever been. In the start of the new 52 the Joker vanished from Arkham Asylum leaving his face sliced off and nail to wall this story picks up one year later where the Joker is back and has stolen his face back to wear like a mask. Somewhere in the demented brain of his he has come to the conclusion that all of Batman's allies are wearing him down and preventing him from being the best superhero he can be so he decided the only logical conclusion is to take them out one by one this is a massive crossover event between multiple comics that when collected together is genuinely chilling and provides an excellent cross section of the jokers personality as well as giving an excellent look into the relationship between Batman and the Joker. Along with that Greg Capullos art renders the whole thing beautifully horrifying( side note since this is a crossover between multiple publications what you don't want to do is buy a trade paperback of one and wound up with a fifth of the story. On the cover it should say the name of the publication along with the title. Ie. Catwoman- Death of the family. Most comic book shops if you say that you want the entire collected storyline they will be able to provide you with it just in case I bought my copy of Barnes and Noble and to be recognizable this edition has a cover printed with Joker- death of the family. As the title.)

Next isn't really Joker story per se however it does feature the Joker and is a very memorable storyline **The Dark Knight Returns** by Frank Miller is regarded in the comic book world as being one of the greatest comic books ever written as it brought Batman back to his dark roots. In this story it takes place 10 years in the future where Batman is 60 years old and retired however he comes out of retirement to save Gotham City along the way his coming out of retirement will awaken several supervillains have lain dormant including the Joker who returns to have a little fun and put a stop to batman and also super man who is working for the government who comes to odds with Batman in the climax of the story. Again while not featuring The Joker as the prominent focus of the story it does give an excellent cross-section into Batman's personality and one cannot truly understand one without the other. In addition this is going to be the inspiration for the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie will draw from prominently. (Disclaimer the art style of Frank Miller is somewhat of an acquired taste and is perhaps not the best first impression for inexperienced readers.)

one I can think of right now is **Endgame** which also written by Snyder with the same art as the the death of the family is the follow up to the death of the family signaling the return of the Joker after those events and exploring yet another possible origins for him however keeping in history with the Joker they never actually give a concrete yes or no as to what his origin story is always keeping a moving target admittedly I have not read the story myself however I have heard that it is entertaining for my local comic book store and will undoubtedly give it a read ( side note I would not recommend this starting off not only because of the fact that it is a follow up to a different book but also the controversial nature of the story which divided the fan base yet again read a couple other of these stories and come back to this one after you've read and liked DOTF)

Simply titled **Joker** by Brian Azzarello tell the story of the Joker being released from prison and his ride back to power with Gotham's underworld told from the point of view of one of his goons Johnny frost. This story in particular is unique because it never actually shows Batman. It does however show the brutal nature of the Joker and his unstable personality from the outsiders pov giving readers a look in. Because this story is set outside of ordinary continuity the writers were free to explore the character in a new way. The unique art style is done less like a comic drawing and more like oil paintings showcasing several iconic Batman villains. If you enjoyed Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character in The Dark Knight this one is definitely for you as he drew heavily from this graphic novel as inspiration from everything to his general appearance to the way in which the character interacts with the supporting characters.

Lastly is "**The Man Who Laughs** written as a follow up to a year one which was the origin story of Batman this story is essentially a retelling of a classic story from 1940 the one in which Batman first comes to head with the Joker. Now I personally like this story purely because of its principal taking a story that nobody will realistically get to read unless they come for 75 years of comics updating the art style to a more modern setting and sending it back out I really can't say anymore about this book but if you're looking for a good Joker story this is definitely one to check out.

Side note please keep in mind that this is a character with a 75 year lineage and that his character has been told many times by many different authors so there are hundreds of storylines graphic novels and trade paperbacks that feature him as the main character that I am probably leaving out these are only the ones that I have read and enjoyed this being my favorite character. So I encourage you if there's a comic book store near you to go and just check out the rack of Joker comics there and see if any of them strike your fancy but this list should be more than enough to get you started.

## Batman and Joker

### First answer - What are the best Batman tpbs with the Joker?

> I think tpbs means Thought Provoking Bible Studies.

11: I know there are mixed feelings on the arc in this sub, but Snyder’s **Death of the Family** (New 52 Batman Vol. 3) got some pretty stellar reviews and is my personal favorite Joker storyline.

10: **Batman: The Man Who Laughs**, Batman and Joker’s first meeting.

6: **Death of the Family** and Endgame. **The Man who Laughs**.

### Second answer - Comics that dive into Batman and Joker’s relationship/psychology

**Well known:**

- **The Killing Joke**

- *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*

  > In other thread: *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. Dark Knight Returns, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

- **A Death in the Family**

- **The Man Who Laughs**

**Underrated:**

- Gotham Central: Soft Targets (Frankly, all of Gotham Central is amazing and you should read it)
- Fool's Errand (Detective Comics #726)
- Joker: Devil's Advocate
- Batman and Robin: Batman & Robin Must Die (big bonus points because it's not actually Bruce and the Joker...but *Dick!Bats* and the Joker), though I'd recommend reading the previous volumes of the run first

**Other:** Scott Snyder's run on Batman, particularly Death of the Family and Endgame. I'm not going to comment either way on Snyder's Joker stories; I think they're worth reading and well-written, and there's some quite interesting and worthwhile commentary on the Batman-Joker relationship in them, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say they're "underrated" or the best Batman-Joker stories of all time.

## Dark comics, especially related to Batman

For Batman:

Arkham Asylum, Dark Knights: Metal, One Shots **Dark Knight Returns**

Non-Batman:

**Watchmen**, Invisibles, **Swamp Thing** (Alan Moore), **Sandman** (Neil Gaiman).

---

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* is probably the darkest. **Dark Knight Returns**, Shaman, The Cult, and Gothic are also really good dark ones.

---

Now what do you mean by "dark?"

*All-Star Batman and Robin* is pretty damn dark in tone and content - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone though.

> As a dark and serious Batman story, I also wouldn't recommend *All Star Batman & Robin*...
>
> ...HOWEVER as a farcical, crazy-town, banana-pants story I wholly recommend *All Star Batman & Robin.*

*Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth* by Morrison is <u>probably the darkest you'll find</u>. It is pretty much all psychological and is fairly light on the blood but it is probably the most all-out horror batman story there is.

*The Black Glove* contains the issue *Joe Chill in Hell* where Batman mentally tortures Joe Chill into committing suicide - that's pretty dark.

*Dark Knight/Dark City* was recently re-released I hear and is probably the most grim Riddler story out there... it starts of pretty dark and stays that way. Got some baby kidnapping and it is generally pretty creepy.

**Killing Joke** has implied rape, house invasion, execution and general mental torture so that's pretty dark.

*Black Mirror* has a lot of psychological darkness and detective work to it and some torture and mutilation too.

Pretty much any ark from the pre 2008ish series *Streets of Gotham* would be about some pretty grim subjects - it was an uneven series.

---

Read Scott Snyder's Batman run. Or **The Long Halloween**, maybe *Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On A Serious Earth*? It's probably harder to find "lighter" Batman stories haha

---

Snyder's Works: Black Mirror, **Court of Owls**, City of Owls, **Death of the Family**, **Endgame**.

Geoff Johns: *Batman: Earth One Vol. 1 & 2*.

Other's: *Death in the Family, Arkham Asylum, Long Halloween*.

> Aside from all the mentioned and you're also interested in the animated universe, Return of the Joker's pretty grim.

## Where to start with Green Lantern

Most people would tell you to start with **Green Lantern: Rebirth**, but I think that story is a bit confusing for a new reader. So here is a list of the events that take place before that story in chronological order. The **bold** ones are a part of Geoff John's run while the *italic* ones are from the 90's:

**Green Lantern: Secret Origin**

*Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight/New Dawn*

*Zero Hour: Crisis in Time*

*The Final Night*

*Day of Judgment*

**Green Lantern: Rebirth**

## Where to start with Swamp Thing

7: Len Wein's *Roots of the Swamp Thing* collects the first appearances of Swampy and establishes some of the main characters that would be used later. Then, move on to the first volume of Alane Moore's **Saga of the Swamp Thing** and work your way up to the sixth volume.

10: New 52's not a bad place to start, although Alan Moore's run is a better place to start (and also just better in general).

---

16: Moore's run redefined the character and is held up as the gold-standard.

Other than that, the recent series by Snyder and then Soule was pretty good.

I also think Nancy Collins run is underrated.

7: Moore's run is not only the best Swap Thing run but also one of the best comic book series ever. Some issues read similar to a prose novel. I honestly don't think there's anything quite like it.

5: Besides the obvious, I would recommend the original Len Wein run, collected in *Roots of the Swamp Thing* and if you want that plus all of pre-Moore Bronze Age Swamp Thing material (besides crossovers) it's all been collected in one of those [new monster omnibuses.](https://www.amazon.com/Swamp-Thing-Bronze-Omnibus-Vol/dp/1401273785) The run preceding Moore's does have plot elements that Moore follows on, so it might give you more of an appreciation for his stuff.

1: I feel the Moore run doesn't really have as much weight behind it without having read any of the previous stuff. At the very least read either the "Dark Genesis" or "Roots of the Swamp Thing" trade first so you can get context for his relationships with Abby and Anton, along with Matthew Cable. After that, you can probably jump to the first Saga of the Swamp Thing trade without missing much.

> Both have the 1st appearance of ST, along with the first 10 or 13 issues respectively.
>
> Apparently there's also a collection called Swamp Thing - Bronze Age and the first volume has the same material of "Roots", but it has a different title.
>
> Boy, I wonder why people have problems getting into comic books.

---

16: Start with Book One and read the subsequent trades. Alan Moore started writing the series at #20 and <u>wrapped up the previous writer’s storyline</u>. #21 (The Anatomy Lesson) is where the series starts to become an all-time great.

Don’t get thrown off too much by the numbering. I’ve never read #1-19 and it’s never affected my enjoyment of the series.

> It's all confusing, I know, but that's why most new reader advice avoids talking about all of this. I usually just say "Here, read this" instead of info-dumping about how the entire industry works. That's another reason publisher's label comics as "Book One". There should be no confusion about which book to buy first—it's book 1. Only the more inquisitive readers like yourself notice the comic numbering and think "Am I buying the right thing?" At that point, the publisher is thinking "Ugh, the Book One thing wasn't clear enough. Maybe we should just get rid of the comic numbering altogether to make it more obvious for the newbies." But then consumers would outcry "Now we can't see which issues are collected in this book! CROOKERY!" Again, more confusing meta-info a new reader doesn't need to worry about.

## Where to start with Flash

12: Wally West recommendations:

The Flash: Born to Run by Mark Waid

The Flash: The Return of Barry Allen by Mark Waid

The Flash: Terminal Velocity by Mark Waid

The Flash: Dead Heat by Mark Waid

The Flash: Race Against Time by Mark Waid

The Flash: Emergency Stop by Grant Morrison

The Flash: The Human Race by Grant Morrison

10: New 52 Barry Allen recommendations:

The Flash: Move Forward by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Rogues Revolution by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Gorilla Warfare by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: Reverse by Brian Buccellato and Francis Manapul

The Flash: History Lessons by Brian Buccellato

>3: The first three of these are really good imo

10: Pre-Flashpoint Barry Allen recommendations:

The Flash: Rebirth by Geoff Johns

The Flash: *The Dastardly Death of the Rogues by Geoff Johns*

The Flash: *The Road to Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

*Flashpoint* by Geoff Johns

4: If you want to read about Barry Allen specifically, then The Flash vol. 1: Move Forward is a pretty good place to start, and very new-reader-friendly. (The current "Flash" series that begins with *The Flash vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice* is also very popular, but I haven't read it so I can't comment.)

If you're up for reading about any Flash then I recommend checking out *Mark Waid's run* from the 1990s, which stars Wally West. This is currently being reprinted in paperback form as The Flash by Mark Waid — there are three volumes out so far. The first volume contains a flashback origin story, "Born to Run", so it's a really good introductory point too. (Be warned, though, that the annuals and the "Flash Special" contained in that volume are nowhere near as good as Mark Waid's run ends up becoming, so don't be put off.)

---

17: Best:

*Mark Waid's run* (The Flash vol 2 #62-129,#142-163 plus some other crossover issues and one shots, will be collected in trades soon as The Flash by Mark Waid Books One to ___). By far the best Wally West run and the best Flash run in general, most modern ideas about the character come from his run. Everything from speedforce to the Flash family was from Waid. It's the best example of a legacy character in comics and has the best character growth I've ever read and it's the reason so many people loved the DCU Rebirth one shot.

Almost the Best:

Geoff Johns' first run (The Flash vol 2 #164-225 plus some crossover issues and one shots. Currently being reprinted as The Flash by Geoff Johns with the third trade coming out in a few months). Following on directly from Waid, this was Geoff Johns' third comics which makes it quite impressive. While he may not have had the grand ideas and perfect voice for Wally that Waid had he did one thing better: the villains. Throughout the run Johns gives the best writing for the Rogues that you will see as well as other villains like Grodd and even a new one, Zoom. It all culminates in Rogue War which was a great finale to the run and a great ending to the greatest (IMO) era of the Flash (1990-2005).

Grant Morrison's and Mark Millar's run (The Flash vol 2 #130-141 and some crossover issues. All collected in one trade a few months ago as The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar). Set during Mark Waid's littel break this run features short, bizarre, silver age style stories with some of the most badass and overpowered feats ever in Flash history (like Wally winning a race against instant transportation). There's also a really nice single issue that will make you love Jay Garrick.

Infantino/Broome's (and Fox's) run (The Flash vol 1 #105-174, also lets throw showcase #4, #8, #13, and #14 in there. Being collected in trade as The Flash: The Silver Age with one volume already out as well as omnibus with the second out later in the year). This might be a bit much for you if you can't handle silver age comics. This is the original Barry Allen stuff that brought about the silver age. It features lots of really wacky, bizarre and outrageous sci-fi/superhero stories. Also Infantino is the definitive Flash artist.

Others worth reading:

William Mesner-Loeb's run (The Flash vol 2 #15-61, though it takes a bit to get up to standard. No reprints). Criminally underrated even by me since very few people bring it up. It's a very good look at a young adult Wally who is still immature and learning how to be a proper adult hero. It has a really great supporting cast and also introduces Linda Park, who Mark Waid later builds upon to write the best relationship on comics.

The Flash: Dastardly Death of the Rogues (and while not collected in the trade, I'll throw in The Flash vol 3 #8). This is part of Johns' second run, this time featuring Barry (Rebirth 09, Blackest Night: Flash, Flash vol 3, Flashpoint) and is the only story where Johns got things properly right (the rest suffers from what felt like an editorial agenda to push Barry and screw over the other characters, plus the other stories have some general writing issues). This also happens to be my favourite Barry story due to the excellent writing and the gorgeous art by Manapul and Buccellato (easily my favourite Flash art). All you really need to know is that it's Barry finally settling in and getting back to business after coming back to life (he was dead from 1985-2008, he saved the universe/multiverse).

New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Thankfully DC's recent Rebirth relaunch is bringing things back with DCU Rebirth #1, *The Flash Rebirth* #1 (2016) + The Flash (2016) ongoing series, and Titans Rebirth #1 + Titans ongoing series.

---

5: Summarize:

The Flash (2011) #0-25 [Origin and a good introduction to The Flash's villains]

*The Flash: Rebirth* (2016) [Re-introduces the history of The Flash which was forgotten]

Then you have two options:

Option 1: The Flash (2016) #1-Present [Upcoming arc is an expanded origin story]

Option 2: The Flash (1987) #62-118 [*Mark Waid's classic run*, which features Wally West as The Flash instead of Barry Allen]

If you want to know why Wally West became The Flash, read Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986), but this is very new-reader unfriendly and requires extensive knowledge of DC Comics history.

4: Starting from the beginning is a long journey, the *Mark Waid series* are good but it’s Wally west. Rebirth is a good Barry Allen jump on point. They’re about to do flash year 1 to give a back story of the new 52/review the flash.

5: Barry Allen started his carrier in the comics in 1956 until 1985 and then he was absent on until 2009. His modern-age series called [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) when he returned. After that 2 trades came (In comics, a trade paperback (often shortened to trade) is a collection of stories originally published in comic books, reprinted in book format, usually capturing one story arc from a single title or a series of stories with a connected story arc or common theme.) called [*The Flash Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Dastardly-Rogues-Brightest/dp/1401231950/) and [*The Flash Vol. 2: The Road to Flashpoint*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Flashpoint-Comics-Unnumbered/dp/1401234488).

After these, a HUGE event came that changed everything called [Flashpont](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384) that "reset" the continuity and started the New 52 age and it's first story-line called [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or alternatively [The Flash: Starting Line (DC Essential Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Starting-Line-DC-Essential/dp/1401284760)) This series (New52) lasted till Spring 2016 and collected 9 trades (the show you watched is based on this era). In early 2016 [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) came (only name change, everything is continued from New52) but a huge exception: a long missing character came back to the grand scene who was missing for so long. Rebirth's first trade is [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X)

So if you are interested in Barry (overall) start with [The Flash: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401230016/) and move onward to [*Flashpont*](https://www.amazon.com/Flashpoint-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401233384), but you can just start with [The Flash, Vol. 1: Move Forward ](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Move-Forward-New/dp/1401235549)or [DC Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/DC-Universe-Rebirth-Geoff-Johns/dp/1401270727) and [*The Flash Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Vol-Lightning-Strikes-Rebirth/dp/140126784X), then read everything up to today. (currently there is a Flash event called Flash War coming out)

But if you are interested in old material, the best place to start is [The Flash: The Silver Age Vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Silver-Age-Vol/dp/1401261108), the first comics where Barry showed up.

(there is an omnibus on sale at the moment (a collection of multiple trades) called [The Flash By Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato Omnibus](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Francis-Manapul-Buccellato-Omnibus/dp/1401261035/) that collects the first 4 trades of the New 52 era.

> If you like TV show, then the current rebirth run might work for you then.
>
> The current rebirth run might work for you then

2: *Flash by Mark Waid* volumes 1-5 Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar Flash by Geoff Johns volumes 1-5

Baron and Messner-Loebs runs are solid as well and do a lot of character development Flash volume 2 issues 1-63

Secret Origins Annual 2 is an awesome Flash story

2: *Flash by Mark Waid vol 1* Flash by Geoff Johns vol 1 Flash by Manapul and Buccellato Flash Rebirth

---

15: The best Flash run is *Mark Waid's run*. Waid built up the Flash Family and introduced the Speedforce into the DC Universe.

That run easily has some of the best Flash stories ever. The only catch is that it's Wally West Flash. Barry Allen sacrificed his life during an event called Crisis on Infinite Earths and Wally took up the mantle.

If you like Barry in the show you'll like Wally in the comics. Wally from the comics is much more similar to Grant Gustin's Flash than the actual Barry from the comics.

[r/theflash](https://www.reddit.com/r/theflash/) has a reading recommendations list for both Barry and Wally. Here's the order I'd recommend for both Barry and Wally

**Reading order for Wally**:
*The Flash by Mark Waid*:
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)

> it's actually released.

*Waid takes a break here*
**The Flash by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar (One trade only)**
*Waid comes back here*
**The Flash by Mark Waid**
Book 6(Not released yet)
**The Flash by Geoff Johns**
Book 1
Book 2
Book 3
Book 4
Book 5(Not released yet)
*Barry Comes Back*
Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*

**Reading Order for Barry**
*The Dastardly Death of the Rogues*
*Flashpoint*
New52 Flash
DC Rebirth #1
*Flash: Rebirth* (2016)

5: *Mark Waid's Flash* (1992-2000) is the best Flash I have ever read, though, granted, I haven't read much else besides his run. I especially like his later stuff, like the "Dark Flash Saga."

> IIRC Dark Flash Saga was never collected in a trade and can only be read through the individual issues (#152-#159). It'll probably be hard to find physical copies but I'm sure if you look hard enough you'd find them somewhere. They are also available in digital copies on Comixology and other digital sites.

3: The Flash | #0, 62-129, 142-159, 162, 231-236; annual 4-6, 8; etc. | 1992-2008 | *Waid*

The Flash | #130-138 | 1997-1998 | Morrison, Millar

The Flash | #164-225, Rogues' Revenge #1-3, Rebirth #1-6, #1-12, etc. | 2000-2011 | Johns

*Flashpoint* | #1-5 | 2011 | Johns

The Flash | #1-29 | 2011-2014 | Manapul, Buccellato

*The Flash (Rebirth)* | #1-ongoing | 2016-2017 | Williamson

1: Everyone will rightfully tell you about *Waid’s* run being the best but if you can find the single issues, it’s worth it to check out Mike Baron and William Messner-Loebs runs since you see the full extent of Wally’s character development.

## Where to start with Wonder Woman

> [Definitive Wonder Woman Collecting Guide and Reading Order](https://crushingkrisis.com/crushing-comics-guide-collecting-dc-comic-books/wonder-woman-collecting-guide-trade-reading-order/#wonder-woman-1987).

5: *The omnibus by Perez*

*Rucka's run* is starting to be reprinted this month

Simone's run is OOP but comes after Rucka's and can be bought on Comixology

New 52 Volumes 1-6 then skip straight to *Rebirth*

Legend of Wonder Woman

Earth One

2: Everything Rucka is a good start

---

> [Good feminist DC comics for birthday present?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/9c8uo4/good_feminist_dc_comics_for_birthday_present/) Wonder Woman seems to have a lot of hit or miss depending on the run itself but she did like wonder woman’s Down to Earth by Greg Rucka. - 
>
> 8: If you want something intellectually feminist, it's a little counter-intuitive, but some of the older WW stuff might be more interesting than the new. Obviously the book is more aware and politically correct now (because of the time), but it's in exchange for when it was actually pretty radical and progressive.
>
> While I don't mean the original bondage-heavy comics (which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?), but for instance the Perez run (1986). This is actually the genesis of 'modern' WW as most people know her. Perez is highly credited by Patty Jenkins for inspiration for the movie (his name is credited 2nd only to Marston). He also had an influential female editor (Karen Berger), and it set the tone for a lot of her ongoing themes: for instance Rucka's embassy-based run (which you mention) was echoing Perez's diplomatic mission from Themyscira to the UN. There's also an issue that presents basically an academic deconstruction of the Pandora myth (as period Greek anti-feminism) in comic form.
>
> Going back to Marston, if she'd *like* the kinkier aspects of that transgressive history of the character, you might also look for Wonder Woman: Earth One by Grant Morrison. These are graphic novels so there's less difficulty collecting trades and making sure you don't miss things, but they essentially re-interpret some of those WMM-era sexual politics with beautiful modern art.
>
> > > which I suspect are challenging to find in collection anyway?
> >
> > They've been reprinted in [Wonder Woman: The Golden Age](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401274447/), with volume 2 coming out [in December.](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Golden-Age-Vol/dp/1401285368/)
> >
> > And I second the Perez recommendation, what I've read of his Wonder Woman is great.
>
> 4: Wonder Woman by Azzarello, Rucka, Simone, and Morrison. Mera got a book not too long ago. Birds of Prey by Simone. Renee Montoya as the Question. Batwoman Elergy or vol 1-4 of the new 52. Not exactly feminist, but Harley Quinn Mad Love, the Kesel run (heh, star wars) or the new 52 title.
>
> 2: My favorites are Wonder Woman (Rucka, Simone, and Azzarello are all great in different ways), Batwoman (the first set of books, by Williams), and anything with a good Lois. The Stephanie Brown Batgirl run is also good in that you get to see both Steph taking on Batgirl and Babs grappling with her role as unwilling mentor.
>
> 1: Wonder Woman Earth One by Grant Morrison and Yannick Paquette. Feminist in a ridiculously radical way imo. The art is absolutely gorgeous though.

---

9: So with her if you are just starting out at as a reader, I recommend the Rebirth Run by Greg Rucka. It even has a Year One Origin Story, and that will give you a good idea of where she’s at in the present day.

So if you are okay with skipping around and reading some past runs, I recommend the *Runs by George Perez*, Greg Rucka’s first run (he had two, one from rebirth and one from the mid 2000’s), and Gail Simone’s Run.

*George Perez’s Wonder Woman Run* is the definitive WW Run, all of the important aspects of Wonder Woman were basically developed here.

If you still want to read more, I would say catch up with her Run Rucka Rebirth Run, it’s on issue 77 I think?

Lastly, Brian Azzarello’s Run from the New 52 is pretty good, it has its problems imo, but I think it reads fine on its own.

1: If you are after the Classic-feel and understanding of the character: You should read the *George Perez-relaunch* from 1986 because it defines the character as she is today, everything everyone else does is measured against that run.

Other good runs in this classic era includes the *first run by Greg Rucka* and arguably that of Gail Simone (though it is rather light). There are also certain one-off stories that may be good to start on: The Heiketia (also by Rucka), League of One, and Who is Wonder Woman are all worth checking out.

Then you have the reboot from 2011, Wonder Woman was reset a little harder than the other big names of DC, but if you are into a book with more of a horror bent than traditional superhero action, the Azzarello run should be on your reading list. (I maintain it was one of the best written books of the New 52 that had a definitive beginning, middle and end that wasn't derailed by what other people were doing).
*Rucka's Rebirth* story is also well written, but I would honestly stick with the Year One story, the Lies wasn't that good because it just felt more like Rucka doing a reintroduction of the characters he created and used in his first run, while basically flushing out what everyone else had done in between (for better or worse).

---

So, this is going to be not a very short list, since I tend to mention a lot of stuff (though it's still considerably shorter than a Superman or Batman list). I'll start with a complete look into all the recommended stuff, with comments on which ones are good starting points.

- *Wonder Woman by Perez* - This is a classic run, a favourite for many. It was where I started reading WW. It is a good introduction to the character and the lore. However since you're new, you might not care for the old style, due to which you can leave this for later.
- *Wonder Woman by Rucka (1st run)* - This is the best WW run according to many. Highly recommended. Good entry point.
- Wonder Woman by Azzarello - This one is a bit divisive, since there are quite a few changes to the character and the lore. I like to think of it as an alternate take on the character rather than a main universe one.
- *Wonder Woman (Rebirth) by Rucka* - This is probably the best starting point. Very well received.
- Wonder Woman by Simone - Another really good Wonder Woman run.
- Wonder Woman by Jimenez - This is not as well-known as the other runs, but it has some fun stuff. Check it out later if you need more of WW.
- Legend of Wonder Woman - I haven't read it but I've heard really good things.
- JLA: A League of One - This one might sound like a JL story but is more of a Wonder Woman story.

TL;DR - Start with Rebirth. After that check out any of Rucka, Perez, Simone or Azzarello, and then other stuff

## Best Harley Quinn comics

**Batman: Mad Love**. I feel like it's the only good Harley comic. I personally think she hasn't been that great since B:TAS, but that's just me. Batman Adventures: My Boyfriend's Back and A Wedding to Die For are also gems.

Harley and Ivy is also a lot of fun but it's nothing serious. Her Pre New 52 solo run was okay until the team changed and then it became unbearable.

In the New 52 she has gone through so many changes, in one issue she was killing 20 kids with bombs, in another she was shown with puppies and being a sweetheart. The New 52 Suicide Squad run was atrocious imo, and Palmiotti and Conner write her as Deadpool basically with same randomness and insanity.

## Best Doctor Who comics



## Best Star Trek comics

3: Peter David's work is generally pretty good. I loved Who Killed Captain Kirk? when I read it way back in high school.

2: Star Trek: *Starfleet Academy*, Star Trek: Boldly Go Vol 1 & 2, Star Trek: Countdown

2: IDW series.

2: As for stuff running now, John Byrne's New Visions is both bizarre and straight out of TOS. Many others are also very good.

Marvel and DC published lots of good stuff in the 80s and 90s, though much of it takes place in the movie era. They are all available on one cd that I think you can still get on amazon. Definitely the best value.

1: I've enjoyed the Star Trek TNG Mirror Broken series. It follows the Mirror universe versions of the Next Generation crew, a fun little 'what if' series.

I also liked the first few issues of Star Trek: Waypoints. One has Geordi as the Captain with a crew of Data.

Lastly, the second Doctor Who and Star Trek crossover was pretty fun. I think [Linkara did a review if it](https://youtu.be/qbknLNB8DcM).

---

5: I don't like a good portion of the later Marvel stuff, but I *love* *STARFLEET ACADEMY*. It's under 20 issues and follows Nog at the Academy with lots of clever tie-ins to the Dominion War and classic trek. There's a really awesome two-parter that brings the cadets to Talos IV and it's pure fanboy fun with some really great characters. Bizarrely, the book's artist went on to direct THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS.

3: I would say that *Starfleet Academy* and *Early Voyages* are the two good Marvel ongoings.

> Good call! Early Voyages is also fantastic. It would be cool if one day both series get proper endings somehow.

4: It seems noone has yet mentioned Countdown, soo...

STAR TREK: COUNTDOWN! Also Star Trek: Nero and Star Trek: Spock (reflections)

---

3: The "Star Trek: Ongoing" series is pretty good in my opinion. They're the only available tie-in to the Abrams-verse timeline and they're overseen by the writers of the movies, making more canon than others.

They also did a decent job with the movie tie-in comics, the prequel and the story behind some of the deleted scenes. The actual movie adaptation was pretty bad, as is the case with most adaptations.

The only other one I've read is Hive, written by Brannon Braga. It's got one issue to go, but so far its pretty fan-fictiony and it's kind of a re-hash.

2: Hive is okay. It takes place some time after Nemesis, so no Mr. Data, Riker and Troi are married, Worf is still an ambassador, and the rest of the crew are scattered to the wind. The problem it has is the same that most Star Trek properties have: There is a need for fan service. The fans expect the original crew to get together to solve this, but they also want them frozen in amber the way they last saw them.

Personally, I am mixed about it. It would make sense for Riker, Worf and Picard to work together, but the rest of the crew have gone on with their lives and should not come back because of expectations.

As for the other series, I've heard good things about it, but I have not made room for it in my pull list.

3: The ones with green lantern (Star Trek/Green Lantern) were cool. Haven't really looked into them, intend to.

2: The Star Trek X-men (Star Trek/X-Men) crossovers from the 90s were both really good.

1: Most of them are not great tbh, I've read a few and the only ones I can recommend are The Enterprise Experiment, Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever, and the TNG Mirror Universe series.

The Enterprise Experiment is a sequel to the Enterprise Incident written by the TOS writer and script editor DC Fontana. It has a real feeling of a lost TOS Script adapted to a comic.

The most well-received Star Trek comics I've seen (not just among Trekkies but among comic book enthusiasts in general) are the TNG Mirror Universe series. They never touched the Mirror Universe (*Mirror Broken*) on TNG so it's fertile ground. It also shows the eventual fate of Mirror Spock. It was so well received that Eaglemoss made a model out of the Mirror Enterprise D for their collection https://shop.eaglemoss.com/usa/star-trek-starships/iss-enterprise-ncc-1701-d

Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever is an adaptation of Ellison's original script that got heavily rewritten. Opinions differ on whether it's better than the final episode, but it's certainly worth taking a look.

1: *Early Voyages*, which was basically a Captain Pike series, was pretty solid, old-school *Trek* (and even more intriguing after *Discovery*'s second season).

1: Boldy Go is really great. I couldn't put them down.

---

2: If you can get your hands on some Gold Key issues from the 60's, those are pretty interesting. But for something more reasonable, Barr and David wrote a bunch of original series and TNG comics for DC in the late 80's and early 90's that are pretty good. There's some DS9 comics from Malibu in the 90's which are ok, but I think I might just have a blind spot for anything DS9.

Over the past few years, Tipton has been writing some pretty good TNG comics. The Mirror Universe minis are especially good, *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*. Terra Incognita came after that, it was ok. The current one is The Q Conflict, and is only 1 issue in. Not sure on it yet. I've heard good things about the Discovery comics, but never bothered to pick them up.

## Best Star Wars comics

5: The best of the new canon IMO are Aphra, Poe Dameron, all the Vaders, and the older Lando miniseries. The main flagship series is middle of the road.

4: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars Legacy!

From the new canon, I liked a lot of the Vader 2015 run, Vader down especially. Haven't kept up to date with anything current though.

> 6: The new Vader run is just as good, if not better, than the 2015 version, so I'd highly recommend it. The *Doctor Aphra* series too.

4: *Knights of the Old Republic* was great fun, dramatic, and inventive. *Republic* told an excellent Quinlan Vos story across a few years and into the Clone Wars. *Agent of the Empire* was great too.

In canon, the current *Darth Vader* (I guess he means *Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*) series has been excellent. The first *Lando* mini-series is probably his best story and one of the best in canon so far, and the *Poe Dameron* series is well worth checking out.

EDIT: And the *Doctor Aphra* series has been absolutely bonkers.

3: legends: dawn of the jedi

canon: darth vader - dark lord of the sith

2: I haven't read a lot of Legends, but the best series in canon so far has been Charles Soule's Darth Vader series (*Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith*). Sometimes they use the title Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith because there was already one Vader series.

---

11: [Soule's canon *Darth Vader* series](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith). Excellent story, art, and writing. Nice for newcomers.

4: Start with the Vader comics, they're by far the best of the current comic canon. There was a 2015 series set after ANH and a 2017 series set in Vaders early days. The 2017 series is the best. You can buy them in collected editions:
https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith

> 3: I agree 100%! The 2017 Vader series has easily been the best Marvel has put out, as far as Star Wars comics.

3: What are your favorite characters/settings in Star Wars right now?

Of the post-Disney comics, the two runs of Vader stories are probably the most popular (for good reason). The Lando and the Obi-Wan & Anakin miniseries are both really great, too.

From Legends, the Legacy series and the Tales of the Jedi comics are both really highly rated.

3: First off I would just like to say that all the Legends comics as well as the NEU comics (on a six month delay) are available on Marvel Unlimited

For a lot of good lists check out [r/StarWarsEU](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsEU/) or [r/starwarscanon](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarscanon/). Also are you just interested in comics or books as well? Also [r/starwars](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwars/) has some archived threads about what books to read on its FAQ.

IF you would like to check on some books your self I suggest using Wookieepedia

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Legends_comics

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_comics

I will give you some of my personal favorites.

Legends (The old canon universe up till the disney purchase in 2015)

Comics:

Tales of the Jedi (Sets the lore and history for the Jedi and Sith that the entire Legends EU would use. And that the NEU is still basing some small parts on)

*Knights of the Old Republic* (A sort of Tie-in to the game but focused on new characters. You have never read about a Jedi like Zayne Carrick before)

Star Wars Republic (The Clone Wars show before the Clone Wars show)

Rebellion/Empire (A lot of good stories mainly about Luke but staring some others as well.

Star Wars Tales (Some true and some not so true stories. Think the most recent point of view book. Also SKIPPY WAS NEVER CANON)

Legacy of the Force (While the NJO series would give some more background all you need to know is that its 137ABY and Luke's great gandson is a force using pirate with a attitude problem)

Now for the NEU/Canon

Comics:

Vader 2015/*2017* (Both Vader series are worth a read)

Poe (They are trying to make Poe and Black Squadron the Rogue Squadon of the NEU and its working. Also get to learn more about Lor San Tekka as well)

Aphra (About a rogue archeologist and her mission to steal everything in the galaxy)

Shattered Empire (Adventures with our heroes days after Endor seen though the eyes of Poe's mom)

Darth Maul (Maul killing people is fun)

Star Wars 2015 (The art is terrible, the characterization is bad, the stories are either great or medicore. But it is the main flagship comic)

Age Of miniseries (which tells stand alone stories from the main three eras of the movies)

---

10: The Obi-Wan and Anakin comic is one if my favorite, along with Poe Dameron!

7: Don't limit yourself to the canon comics! The best Star Wars comics out there are some of the older non-canon ones that were originally published by Dark Horse. They *should* all be on Marvel unlimited. My favourite on-goings were *Republic*/*Dark Times* (same series, had a name change after the story caught up to a certain infamous galactic event involving a 66th order - though, on the balance, I feel like the *Dark Times* books are better and you could totally start with them), and *Knights of the Old Republic*. There are a few shorter series or parts of on-goings that really stand out, too. Any of the *Darth Vader and the [insert subtitle]* series are great, except *...Lost Command,* which I felt was pretty weak. The final arc of *Tales of the Jedi,* which unless I'm remembering my titles wrong is called *Redemption,* is great.

Also, just as an aside, if you're in to big space adventures and you have the time to read it, check out the 2006 Marvel Cosmic event *Annihilation* - if you like Star Wars, you'd probably like it, too. [Here's a link to a reading order!](http://comicbookreadingorders.com/marvel/events/annihilation-reading-order/)

7: Lando is the best of the new comics, I think. It's an interesting, self-contained story. There aren't too many outlandish things (I'm looking at you, Poe) and it really adds a lot to Lando's character and motivations. It's really well written, and even adds something extra to ESB for me, which is quite a feat. I can't recommend it enough!

---

1: Ledgends Canon:

Tales of the Jedi (Takes place a long time ago and talks about the start of the Sith and some important Lords and Jedi Masters)

*KOTOR* (acctually focused on a different jedi and not Revan but still a great read)

Republic/The Clone Wars (focused on the era between Naboo and ep 2 then moves onto arcs dealing with the Clone Wars)

Rebellion/Empire (Stories from the Rebellion and Empire and shows a more neutral imperial view)

Legacy (Takes place 75 years after the death of Luke/Han/Leia. Lots of intersting characters and cool fights)

Smaller ones: Mara Jade emperors hand, Dark Times, X-wing, Jedi hunt.

Canon:

Star Wars (The main title detailing Han/leia/luke after Yavin)

*Darth Vader* (Enough said)

Kannan: The last padawn (Kannan dealing with the death of his master and order 66)

Shattered Empire (Lead up to TFU)

Poe Dameron (New Comic just started)

*Obi wan* & *Anakin* ( cool adventures and getting to see the two interact)

Here is a list of all comics Ledgends and Disney Canon for you to look at. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_comics

Amazon, Comixology, Dark Horse, Marvel are all great legal places to get the comics. Though if money is tight there are Kickass places to get them. Though thats Pirating them and that would be Bad

## Best authors

### Alan Moore

What's there to really say? Probably the greatest comic writer of all time. Has a thorough understanding of the history of not only the characters he's writing, but literature in general. And is able to weave an incredible amount of ideas in to the smallest amount of details in a panel.

First comic I read was Watchmen, I was pretty young maybe 13. Didn't fully get it at the time, but loved the scope, characters and style of storytelling. It was one of the first times in my life I read a book because I enjoyed it. I've read much of his work and have seriously enjoyed virtually every one.

Because he takes comics to another level of depth, creativity and realism. He exemplifies taking the medium to another level. **Watchmen**, Miracleman, V for Vendetta, Supreme, **Swamp Thing** and **From Hell** are some of the best ever done.

Has a knack for real thematic depth and insight into human nature with a ton of great quotes while still writing stories that are entertaining even just from a relatively shallow perspective.

> Best story arcs-Watchmen, Killing Joke, The Floronic Man arc of Swamp Thing

The best there is. Comics would be completely different without him. No one has had a bigger impact since the 80s.

What can I say that hasn’t already been said? great writer

### Ed Brubaker

Criminal is one of my favorite sagas in comics and everything he and Sean Phillips have done together I’ve loved, especially *The Fade Out*. Top notch stuff.

Others have mentioned this, but he's really mastered mystery writing. If you've ever picked up his singles and read the backmatter, you can see why. He's always checking out the classics whether it's novels, film, or comics.

I love crime stories and his takes have never disappointed, but he also has some fun superhero tales mixed in. Criminal, Fatale, Incognito, X-Men.

Ed Brubaker - Fatale, Incognito, Kill or Be Killed, *Fade Out* etc.

Everything he's done with Sean Phillips is amazing.

### Warren Ellis

Does high concept stuff really well similar to Morrison, but tackles more modern subject matter. Most notably technology. He also writes “realistic” superheroes the best.

Able to write in so many different styles. Usually is able to insert his sense of occasionally juvenile humor. A bit of a futurist with nostalgia for certain things past, it's always interesting to see where he thinks we might be headed.

His work makes me scared to be in his head. I love that he is never afraid to try anything good or bad. Transmetropliton, Global Frequency, Plantary, Authority, Black Summer, The Wild Storm.

One of comics' best thinkers. Not always the best execution but certainly aiming higher than most out there.

His imaginative and creativity is awesome.

My go-to for a fix of out-there science fiction concepts and ascerbic social and political commentary.

### Jonathan Hickman

A world-builder extroardinaire with a flair for long-game storytelling and a wicked sense of humour. 

He can make complex stories a breeze. 

A long form story telling god, East of West and his Secret Wars saga speak for themselves in this regard. favorite work- East of West

His Avengers/New Avengers saga, concluded in Secret Wars is one of my favorite epics of the medium. Beyond that his indie work is similarly incredible.

### Jeff Lemire

I feel like Lemire is someone who can just do it all. Doesn't matter what genre it is, or if it's even a genre work at all. He can tell a story about two people sitting in a room and it's as interesting as anything. He's great at making his characters feel very human and real, no matter what the situation around them is.

This guy has an amazing ability to tug on your heartstrings. Damn good artist, too.

He is an amazing writer. he knows how to tug at heartstrings and really make you feel for characters. the king of melancholy writing. favorite work- Black Hammer.

His ability to bring something new to established heroes as well as create compelling original stories and characters is very impressive. Moon Knight, Animal Man and Justice League Dark are all fresh and interesting takes and Black Hammer and Sweet Tooth are both incredible stand alone series.

### Frank Miller

He reinvented Batman with **The Dark Knight Returns** and **Year One**, but his work on Daredevil saved the character and turned him into a heartbeat of the Marvel Universe. I love his dialogue and ability to put a Eastwood quote into any situation. He coveys underlying sadness and guilt effortlessly. Both *Daredevil* runs, Just Dark Knight Returns And Year One, 300, Sun City, Ronin.

He's a legend. Like Alan Moore, he is undoubtedly one of the GOATs. Looking past his incredible (and much celebrated) Batman work and Sin City, his four issue Wolverine story is a personal favorite.

### Grant Morrison

Like Moore, has a great understanding of the characters he's writing, and knowledge beyond just the comic format. While Moore is generally more subtle in his approach to getting ideas across, Morrison takes the wildest route imaginable. It's usually bombastic and weird, yet always in homage to those that came before him.

I think he’s the greatest writer in the medium’s history. He can do really high concept stuff like The Invisibles or Final Crisis better than anyone.

He makes me think harder than any other writer.

The writer who got me into comics, his Batman is my favorite run and his Vertigo work are some of the best written comics.

Great at high-concept, out-of-this world storytelling. Love his take on superheroes and superhumanity as allegories for humanity striving to be the best possible version of itself, and I dig the generally optimistic worldview many of his stories promote (Even his darker stories have a hopeful undertone to them).

Don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said better by other people but his way of making super stories feel fresh while also very true to their roots is basically unmatched

### Rick Remender

His work tends to feel extremely personal in a way that I don't really see from anyone else. Which isn't to say no one else's work *is* personal to them, but Remender just writes in a way that really shows it. You can easily see what the real-world themes behind the stories are, and it's always very human. It leaves me thinking not only about the specific stories he tells and the characters within them, but how the greater ideas apply to me and my own life. Obviously that's all subjective, and the themes he tends to explore are often relevant to me in the first place.

Rick Remender- amazing story teller, often has unlikeable characters at first you learn to feel for. defiantly the most depressed writer on my list. favorite work- Deadly Class.

> Haven’t heard much about Remender. What works do you recommend? - Mostly his Image books, they're some of my favorite comics, period. The best ones, in my opinion, are LOW, Tokyo Ghost, Black Science, Fear Agent, Deadly Class, Seven to Eternity, and Death or Glory.

Creates these nothing characters and then twists and drags them through Hell without a possibility of relief. Deadly Class, Black Science, Fear Agent, X-Force and Low are inventive and fresh.

### Greg Rucka

Rucka is the one on this list who I've been a fan of the longest. His first Wonder Woman run way back is one of my favorite DC stories of all time, and his current books at Image are some of my favorites. He definitely has a type of character that his books tend to focus on, but I'm a fan of his style.

Love his Wonder Woman, Batman, Gotham Central, and others; I've liked the vast majority of his work that I've read.

Creates worlds that feel relatable. His characters have a weight to them-you can feel them. He would be here just for Lazarus, but Gotham Central, The Old Guard, Wonder Woman, Black Magic are all great stories...just noticed the strong female lead connection.

Very similar reason to Brubaker with crime and spy stories, but Lazarus its self is a thing of beauty. Stumptown, Queen & Country, Veil, The Question, Wonder Woman.

### Scott Snyder

While I like a good portion of his DC work, his Vertigo and Image stuff is where he really shines in my opinion. The Wake, while not often talked about, is a favorite of mine. I'd love to see more Wytches and American Vampire. Hopefully Undiscovered Country doesn't end up in a similar situation.

Batman is my favorite superhero. His Batman work is some of my favorite, from Black Mirror through New 52 Batman and his newer stuff like All-Star Batman, its one of the great runs on a character.

Have only really read his Batman, but Snyder is a jack of all trades. He expertly balances plot, character development, emotion, blockbuster action, big speeches and horror. He always aims high and never phones in a story arc.

> Best Story Arcs-Court Of Owls, Zero Year.

### Brian K. Vaughan

Between **Saga**, Y: The Last Man, and Paper girls, BKV is just *fun*. He has a great sense for balancing light, fun character stuff that makes you like his characters with the more serious, emotional stuff to get the best payoff possible when things start to go bad.

**Saga** is the best comic series ever, imo. Serious credit also goes to Fiona Staples, but combined with Y and The Oath (Dr. Strange), he's one of my go tos.

### Mark Waid

Somewhat similar to Tomasi in terms of writing very human empathetic character driven stories. However, they have different strong suits. Mark Waid is better at having a character arc over the course of a larger story arc, but his individual emotional scene's don't work quite as well as Tomasi's. Also, his runs tend to have a lot of filler arcs without much character development (especially Flash and Daredevil). I like how he's optimistic, but isn't afraid to show his characters as flawed without making them anti heroes. 

> Best story arcs-Superman Birthright, The Return Of Barry Allen, most of his Fantastic Four run.

I think he's the best pure super hero writer it there. No matter the character he does great entertaining work. Daredevil, FF, Spidey are all amazing and he seems to be able to bring the most out of every hero.

### Honorable mentions

Jason Aaron: Great with heroes like Waid, especially Thor obviously, but also able to do good indie stuff. I feel like he's always solid no matter the book.

Jeffrey Brown - his early autobio stuff is still my favourite thing in comics.

Kurt Busiek, Mark Waid, Alan Davis, Roger Stern, Roy Thomas. Because they have written some of the best runs of all time, because they love superheroes, because they don't wish to deconstruct or decompress or derange or de anything, and because their work is smart, and most importantly, fun.

> Kurt Busiek: Astro City and Conan. Both great reads.

Mike Carey - There aren't many other writers out there who can better handle an epic fantasy comic. Mike Carey - Hellblazer, Lucifer, X-men.

Chris Claremont - His X-men magnum opus. His X-Men runs, even when weird are interesting. He developed the superhero team I never can seem to completely stop reading and his issues are favorites.

Peter David-makes me think about the psychology of the character more than anyone else. He is inventive and knows how to inject the kind of humor that make the Marvel movies work, but it is his deep characterization that makes him one of my favorites. Incredible Hulk and X-Factor.

Al Feldstein - brilliant writer, he wrote some of EC’s best stories and paved the way for geniuses like Moore.

Neil Gaiman - he writes stories and creates characters that drive my own imagination (**Sandman**). The most versatile writer I know.

Kieron Gillen - A never-ending fountain of creativity with an incredible grasp of how comicbooks function as a medium, ceaselessly coming up with new ways to use that grasp to push comic book storytelling into new avenues.

Geoff Johns - he knows how to bring wow moments in any comic he writes. Flash, **Green Lantern**.

Mike Mignola: One of the best short story crafters out there. Great sense of mood, pacing and humor. Very poetic.

Peter Milligan - as clever as Moore & Morrison, just check out *Enigma* to see why. His Hellblazer and X-Statix, X-Statix in particular is a great read. Also the Batman story Dark Night, Dark City.

Russel- I love his views on society. I dont always agree with them, but I enjoy them nonetheless. I mean the man got me to pull the Wonder Twins. The Flintstones, Lone Ranger, Prez, God is disappointed in you.

Jeff Smith - his characters, no matter how far fetched they are, seem real and relatable.

## Conclusion

Best Batman comic books: **Year One**, **The Long Halloween**, **Dark Victory**, **The Dark Knight Returns**, **Court of Owls**, *Arkham Asylum: A serious House on a Serious Earth*.

Best Flash books: 

- Wally West: *The Flash by Mark Waid* - best run!

- Barry Allen: *The Flash (2010-2011) Vol. 1: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues (The Flash: Rebirth series)*, *The Flash (2010-2011): The Road To Flashpoint (The Flash: Rebirth series Book 2)*, *Flashpoint*, New52 Flash, (DC Rebirth #1), Flash: Rebirth (2016) (*The Flash (2016-) Vol. 1: Lightning Strikes Twice*), and so forth. 

  > Flash: Rebirth (2009) <- *Don't Start With Barry Here. (It'll confuse you)*
  >
  > New 52 The Flash volumes 1-5. Written and with art by the same artists of Dastardly Death of the Rogues, like much of the new 52 reboot it was a jumping on point. The art is beautiful and the writing is solid and fun. However pretty much all Flash lore was scrapped which is disappointing, more so if you read the previous recommendations.

Best Harley Quinn books: **Batman: Mad Love**.

Best Star Trek comics: *Mirror Broken* and *Through the Mirror*, others are not great tbh.

Best Star Wars comics: 

- Legends: *Knights of the Old Republic*.
- Canon: *Darth Vader*, **Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith**.
