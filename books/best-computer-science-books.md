### Main books

#### Beginner

[Grokking Algorithms An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio) by Aditya Y. Bhargava  (casual book for fun)

[Algorithms: Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena (a great resource - concise, clear explanations of algorithm fundamentals, using real-world examples (ie. social networks as graphs), saving detailed theory and proofs for other textbooks.)

> Here is a free version of the "The Algorithm Design Manual": [link](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/TDBAfl/VT06/algorithms/BOOK/BOOK/BOOK.HTM). I think this is 1st edition (could be outdated).

[Algorithm Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design) by Jon Kleinberg, Éva Tardos (not a reference book like CLRS, the presentation of each topic is so well-covered, so perfectly-paced, so thorough, and so readable, that you almost forget you're reading a textbook; best graph explanation; it hits the sweet spot between intuition and mathematical rigor more precisely than any textbook I've seen; however some people think that it is terribly written)

[Algorithms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138563.Algorithms) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani (the boos is free according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/osglz/good_textbook_on_data_structures_and_algorithms/) (see how to download the book below); the book is very well written, thorough, and focuses on all the important stuff without being the reference manual that "introduction to algorithms by CLRS" is; it has the perfect balance between being curt and being comprehensive (almost like Kleinberg and Tardos's book))

> Here is the link on the free book: [link](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html). You can see that the book is unavailable, however you can get the particular chapters of the book by using the search on their site: [TOC](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/toc.pdf), [Ch1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap0.pdf), [Ch2](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap1.pdf), [Ch3](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap2.pdf), [Ch4](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap4.pdf), [Ch5](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap5.pdf), [Ch6](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf), [Ch7](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap7.pdf), [Ch8](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap8.pdf), [Ch9](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap9.pdf), [Ch10](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap10.pdf).

[Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), 4th ed. by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (it's actually very hard to read; the authors repeat terminology and their words too often (too much water); the course on Coursera is better)

[Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide C++](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16253895-elements-of-programming-interviews) by Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, Tsung-Hsien Lee (the book is loaded with great problems and puzzles; the solutions are very comprehensive; this is a refined version for the algorithms for Interviews)

[Algorithms in a Nutshell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4229486-algorithms-in-a-nutshell) by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice, Stanley Selkow (short book; abstruse explanations of the basic algorithms make this book readable only for experts in Computer Science field; the 1-pager per algorithm is great)

[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College (free book; amazing interactive ebook)

[Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/AlgoComp.pdf) by Herbert S. Wilf (free book; an introductory textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms; algorithms associated with the network flow problem are fundamental in many areas of graph connectivity, matching theory, etc; algorithms in number theory are discussed with some applications to public key encryption)

[Animated Algorithm and Data Structure Visualization](http://visualgo.net/) (resource)

[Algorithms Course Materials](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) - Jeff Erickson (free book; it is more a textbook for a class, not a book you can read on your own;  it worries a lot less about the knuthian style of analysis and worries a lot more about building intuition for the subject matter; beautiful)

[Open Data Structures: An Introduction](http://opendatastructures.org/) by Pat Morin (free book; Open Data Structures covers the implementation and analysis of data structures for sequences (lists), queues, priority queues, unordered dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, and graphs; focusing on a mathematically rigorous approach that is fast, practical, and efficient, Morin clearly and briskly presents instruction along with source code.)

[Foundations of Computer Science](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html) by Al Aho and Jeff Ullman (free book; this book combines the theoretical foundations of computing with essential discrete mathematics; easily one of the best books about fundamental computer science, can be used as a Discrete Math and Data Structures textbook as well)
