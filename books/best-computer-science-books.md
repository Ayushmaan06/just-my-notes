### Main books

#### Beginner

[Grokking Algorithms An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio) by Aditya Y. Bhargava  (casual book for fun)

[Algorithms: Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena (a great resource - concise, clear explanations of algorithm fundamentals, using real-world examples (ie. social networks as graphs), saving detailed theory and proofs for other textbooks.)

> Here is a free version of the "The Algorithm Design Manual": [link](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/TDBAfl/VT06/algorithms/BOOK/BOOK/BOOK.HTM). I think this is 1st edition (could be outdated).

[Algorithm Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design) by Jon Kleinberg, Éva Tardos (not a reference book like CLRS, the presentation of each topic is so well-covered, so perfectly-paced, so thorough, and so readable, that you almost forget you're reading a textbook; best graph explanation; it hits the sweet spot between intuition and mathematical rigor more precisely than any textbook I've seen; however some people think that it is terribly written)

[Algorithms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138563.Algorithms) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani (the boos is free according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/osglz/good_textbook_on_data_structures_and_algorithms/) (see how to download the book below); the book is very well written, thorough, and focuses on all the important stuff without being the reference manual that "introduction to algorithms by CLRS" is; it has the perfect balance between being curt and being comprehensive (almost like Kleinberg and Tardos's book))

> Here is the link on the free book: [link](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html). You can see that the book is unavailable, however you can get the particular chapters of the book by using the search on their site: [TOC](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/toc.pdf), [Ch1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap0.pdf), [Ch2](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap1.pdf), [Ch3](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap2.pdf), [Ch4](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap4.pdf), [Ch5](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap5.pdf), [Ch6](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf), [Ch7](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap7.pdf), [Ch8](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap8.pdf), [Ch9](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap9.pdf), [Ch10](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap10.pdf).

[Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), 4th ed. by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (it's actually very hard to read; the authors repeat terminology and their words too often (too much water); the course on Coursera is better)

[Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/AlgoComp.pdf) by Herbert S. Wilf (free book; an introductory textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms; algorithms associated with the network flow problem are fundamental in many areas of graph connectivity, matching theory, etc; algorithms in number theory are discussed with some applications to public key encryption)

[Animated Algorithm and Data Structure Visualization](http://visualgo.net/) (resource)

[Algorithms Course Materials](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) - Jeff Erickson (free book; it is more a textbook for a class, not a book you can read on your own;  it worries a lot less about the knuthian style of analysis and worries a lot more about building intuition for the subject matter; beautiful)

[Open Data Structures: An Introduction](http://opendatastructures.org/) by Pat Morin (free book; Open Data Structures covers the implementation and analysis of data structures for sequences (lists), queues, priority queues, unordered dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, and graphs; focusing on a mathematically rigorous approach that is fast, practical, and efficient, Morin clearly and briskly presents instruction along with source code.)

Anderson (free book; an impressive technical book that looks at security in all its forms (physical, computer based, social) and shows you the various ways security can be implemented and compromised; whether you are interested in general security or only in one aspect of security, this is a good book to read, and after reading it, you will get a very good idea of how hard it actually is to make a system secure and why you must hire very capable people to do it and to avoid 'snake-oil' security implementations; good!)

[Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/index.html) (free book; a good book for self learning and also class study; the concepts are very well explained; good!)

[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70156.Patterns_of_Enterprise_Application_Architecture) by Martin Fowler, David Rice, Matthew Foemmel, Edward Hieatt, Robert Mee, Randy Stafford (could be outdated; relational databases still play a large role in many enterprise applications, but this material either predates or ignores other types of storage like distributed file systems (e.g., HDFS) and key-value storage (e.g., Redis); and with so many web applications using cloud services, horizontal scaling is practically a must for anything serious; this is a book you might want on your shelf because people may occasionally mention some of the patterns it describes (such as Active Record and Unit of Work; also, many of the patterns in the general section at the end of the book are quite good); amazing!)

[Agile Planning: From Ideas to Story Cards](https://launchschool.com/books/agile_planning) by Launch School (free book)

[Domain Driven Design Quickly](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly) by Floyd Marinescu (free book; it is an easy to read summary that explains the main points of Domain-Driven Design; without the repetition and only small but meaningful examples you can get up to speed in no time and start exploring the topic on your own with real code; if you made your own experiences and like to go a bit deeper in certain points you still can go for the book of Eric Evans; good)

[DSL Engineering: Designing, Implementing and Using Domain-Specific Languages](http://dslbook.org/) by Markus Voelter (free book; this book is about creating domain-specific languages; it covers three main aspects: DSL design, DSL implementation and software engineering with DSLs; the book only looks at external DSLs and focuses mainly on textual syn-
tax; good!)

[How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/) by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi (free book; unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process; this approach fosters a variety of skills--critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail--that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers; a true gem if you are learning to program, but a bit too slow-paced if you already are a proficient programmer; good!)

[Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook) by by Henrik Kniberg, Mattias Skarin (free book; a short and colloquial introduction to Kanban, and/but mostly by comparing it to Scrump; if you're considering switching your shop to "Agile" methods, and/or are dissatisfied with the more traditional (!?!?)

[Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/) by S. Demeyer, S. Ducasse and O. Nierstrasz (free book; refactoring Legacy code is as important as the subject is dry, therefore not well considered. This is the subject of this book where a 9 step process is proposed; each step, embedded in a chapter, take the shape of a pattern language; because that's it: a patterns book; unfortunately, the angle doesn't catch us even if this choice is a good one for the subject; good)

[Patterns Principles and Practices of Domain Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25531393-patterns-principles-and-practices-of-domain-driven-design) by Scott Millett (this book distils the ideas and theories of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) philosophy into a practical play-book that you can leverage to simplify application development for complex problem domains; good!)
