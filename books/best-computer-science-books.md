## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Main books

#### Beginner

**[Grokking Algorithms An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio) by Aditya Y. Bhargava  (casual book for fun; amazing!)**

**[Algorithms: Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena (a great resource - concise, clear explanations of algorithm fundamentals, using real-world examples (ie. social networks as graphs), saving detailed theory and proofs for other textbooks; amazing!)**

> Here is a free version of the "The Algorithm Design Manual": [link](http://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/TDBAfl/VT06/algorithms/BOOK/BOOK/BOOK.HTM). I think this is 1st edition (could be outdated).

**[Algorithm Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design) by Jon Kleinberg, Éva Tardos (not a reference book like CLRS, the presentation of each topic is so well-covered, so perfectly-paced, so thorough, and so readable, that you almost forget you're reading a textbook; best graph explanation; it hits the sweet spot between intuition and mathematical rigor more precisely than any textbook I've seen; however some people think that it is terribly written; amazing!)**

[Algorithms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138563.Algorithms) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani (the boos is free according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/osglz/good_textbook_on_data_structures_and_algorithms/) (see how to download the book below); the book is very well written, thorough, and focuses on all the important stuff without being the reference manual that "introduction to algorithms by CLRS" is; it has the perfect balance between being curt and being comprehensive (almost like Kleinberg and Tardos's book); good!)

> Here is the link on the free book: [link](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html). You can see that the book is unavailable, however you can get the particular chapters of the book by using the search on their site: [TOC](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/toc.pdf), [Ch1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap0.pdf), [Ch2](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap1.pdf), [Ch3](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap2.pdf), [Ch4](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap4.pdf), [Ch5](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap5.pdf), [Ch6](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf), [Ch7](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap7.pdf), [Ch8](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap8.pdf), [Ch9](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap9.pdf), [Ch10](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap10.pdf).

**[Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), 4th ed. by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (it's actually very hard to read; the authors repeat terminology and their words too often (too much water); the course on Coursera is better; amazing!)**

[Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide C++](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16253895-elements-of-programming-interviews) by Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, Tsung-Hsien Lee (the book is loaded with great problems and puzzles; the solutions are very comprehensive; this is a refined version for the algorithms for Interviews; good!)

[Algorithms in a Nutshell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4229486-algorithms-in-a-nutshell) by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice, Stanley Selkow (short book; abstruse explanations of the basic algorithms make this book readable only for experts in Computer Science field; the 1-pager per algorithm is great; good!)

[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College (free book; amazing interactive ebook; good!)

[Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/AlgoComp.pdf) by Herbert S. Wilf (free book; an introductory textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms; algorithms associated with the network flow problem are fundamental in many areas of graph connectivity, matching theory, etc; algorithms in number theory are discussed with some applications to public key encryption)

[Animated Algorithm and Data Structure Visualization](http://visualgo.net/) (resource)

[Algorithms Course Materials](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) by Jeff Erickson (free book; it is more a textbook for a class, not a book you can read on your own;  it worries a lot less about the knuthian style of analysis and worries a lot more about building intuition for the subject matter; beautiful)

[Open Data Structures: An Introduction](http://opendatastructures.org/) by Pat Morin (free book; Open Data Structures covers the implementation and analysis of data structures for sequences (lists), queues, priority queues, unordered dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, and graphs; focusing on a mathematically rigorous approach that is fast, practical, and efficient, Morin clearly and briskly presents instruction along with source code; good)

**[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70156.Patterns_of_Enterprise_Application_Architecture) by Martin Fowler, David Rice, Matthew Foemmel, Edward Hieatt, Robert Mee, Randy Stafford (could be outdated; relational databases still play a large role in many enterprise applications, but this material either predates or ignores other types of storage like distributed file systems (e.g., HDFS) and key-value storage (e.g., Redis); and with so many web applications using cloud services, horizontal scaling is practically a must for anything serious; this is a book you might want on your shelf because people may occasionally mention some of the patterns it describes (such as Active Record and Unit of Work; also, many of the patterns in the general section at the end of the book are quite good); amazing!)**

[How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing](http://www.htdp.org/) by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi (free book; more like a book on programming; unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process; this approach fosters a variety of skills--critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail--that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers; a true gem if you are learning to program, but a bit too slow-paced if you already are a proficient programmer; good!)

### API

Vlissides (found this one on my GoogleDrive; this book was recommended by Alexander Khizha for the second course work; John Vlissides goes through design of an imaginary file system, exploring and applying design patterns; good)

[Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/) by S. Demeyer, S. Ducasse and O. Nierstrasz (free book; refactoring Legacy code is as important as the subject is dry, therefore not well considered; this is the subject of this book where a 9 step process is proposed; each step, embedded in a chapter, take the shape of a pattern language; because that's it: a patterns book; unfortunately, the angle doesn't catch us even if this choice is a good one for the subject; good)

[Patterns Principles and Practices of Domain Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25531393-patterns-principles-and-practices-of-domain-driven-design) by Scott Millett (this book distils the ideas and theories of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) philosophy into a practical play-book that you can leverage to simplify application development for complex problem domains; good!)
