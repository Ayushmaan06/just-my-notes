## Terminology

"**Comics**" is used as a [non-count noun](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Non-count_noun), and thus is used with the singular form of a verb, in the way the words "politics" or "economics" are, to refer to the medium, so that one refers to the "comics industry" rather than the "comic industry". "Comic" as an adjective also has the meaning of "funny", or as pertaining to comedians, which can cause confusion and is usually avoided in most cases ("comic strip" being a well-entrenched exception).

"**Comic**" as a singular noun is sometimes used to refer to individual comics periodicals, what are known in North America as "[comic books](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comic_book)".

![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Comics_page_layout_example.png/440px-Comics_page_layout_example.png)

A typical comics page layout.

**A** is a **panel**

**B** is a **borderless** panel

Violet are the **gutters**

Green is a **tier**

A **splash** or **splash page** is a large, often full-page illustration which opens and introduces a story. Often designed as a decorative unit, its purpose is to capture the reader's attention, and can be used to establish time, place and mood.

A **[spread](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spread_(typography))** is an image that spans more than one page. The **two-page spread** or **double-page spread** is the most common, but there are spreads that span more pages, often by making use of a foldout (or [gatefold](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gatefold)).

### Comic book formats

A **[comic book](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comic_book)**, also known as a **comic** or **floppy**, is a periodical, normally thin in size and stapled together. Comic books have a greater variety of units of encapsulation than comic strips, including the [panel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Glossary_of_comics_terminology#Panel), the page, the [spread](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Glossary_of_comics_terminology#Spread), and inset panels. They are also capable of more sophisticated layouts and compositions. A floppy comic is also known as an [American comic book](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/American_comic_book).

Well for starters there's the regular floppy comic issues that come out, these are often monthly. When a story arc of these "**floppies**" comes out it's usually collected in a paperback called a "**trade paperback**" or "**graphic novel**". However there are bigger collections that group together a few paperbacks worth of story and these are called "**omnibuses**". That's where you'll get the most story for your money and it gathers a lot of stuff in order so that's why people are recommending getting an omnibus edition. For example, *Hellboy Omnibus Volume 1* is where you should start.

> floppies (issues) → trade paperbacks (TPB) → omnibus

According to this [source](https://www.howtolovecomics.com/comic-book-glossary-of-terms/) there are many formats of comic books:

<u>**Single Issue**</u> **–** This is the serial magazine-style format of a comic. Generally, 20-32 pages of a story but sometimes can be more, with some being up to 100 pages. These are generally numbered in chronological order eg. Issue #5.

**Prestige Edition –** These are comics that are generally 48-64 pages long that have a thin spine.

**Digital Comics –** Editions of comics that can be viewed on computer screens, tablets or mobile phones.

**Digital First** **–** This is where a comic is released in a digital format first then later in print.

**Collected Edition –** This is where multiple single issues are collected to create a whole story or set of stories, often collecting 5-6 single issues.

There are many kinds of collected editions including…

- **<u>Trade Paperback (TPB)</u> –** This is the most common kind of collected edition where it is usually collecting 5-8 single issues. It is in a paperback format and can be often referred to as a “trade”. [Read here to find out if reading in trade paperback is for you.](https://www.howtolovecomics.com/2013/12/10/trade-waiting-advantages-disadvantages/)
- **Digest –** These are collected editions that are smaller in height and length. The most popular comics in this format are All Ages comics and Manga.
- **<u>Hardcover (HC)</u> –** Similar to a Trade Paperback but the cover has a very thick stock just like a hardcover novel. Sometimes these collected editions can collect more single issues than Trade Paperbacks, with 12 issues common.
- **<u>Omnibus</u> –** These are very large hardcover collections. These collections can can be 25+ singles issues collected. Often these collect entire series or a creative run on a comic series.
- **Graphic Novel –** Often a fancier term for collected edition but can also be used to describe an OGN. Essentially any comic that is bounded like a book. Some people use the term graphic novel to make the comic book medium sound more serious.
- **Original Graphic Novel (OGN) –** This is a comic book that comes out in the trade paperback/hardcover format without being in the serial single issue format beforehand.

**Variant Cover –** A variant cover is an alternative cover of a single issue. Most of the time it includes the art of a different artist and are often fewer of these available. [More information on variant covers.](https://www.howtolovecomics.com/2013/08/22/whats-the-deal-with-variant-covers/)

**Incentive Cover –** A variant cover in which the retailer has to order x amount of a cover to redeem the variant cover. For example the retailer might need to or 10, 25, 50 or maybe even 100 of the regular cover to be eligible to order the variant.

**Limited Series/Mini-series** – This is a comic series that has a set number of issues. Most commonly it is 6 issues but it will often vary depending on the story. The series has a beginning, middle and an end.

**Maxi-series** – A maxi-series is a longer mini-series generally 12 issues or longer but often each publisher has a different definition. Often mini-series of 12 issues duration has been referred to as maxi-series.

**Annual** – An over-sized special of a comic book that is released in addition to the regular comics in that series.

**One-shot –** A story that is contained to a single issue.

**Webcomic** – Comics that are made for viewing on the Internet This could be in a comic strip format or as an on-going narrative.

**Mini-comic** – A comic that is smaller than the conventional comic book size. Generally, these comics are handmade with a DIY ethos and have small print runs.

**Zine –** Self-published and often handmade comic or magazine. I talk more about zines [here](https://www.howtolovecomics.com/2015/02/25/why-zines-are-a-great-way-to-enjoy-comics/).

**Floppies –** A slang term for the single issue comic. Called so as it is used with floppy paper.

## Recommendations

Four options I've heard recommended:

1. Pick one of the major storylines or special events and get the collected version that has most/all of the issues that were involved. Read that, and try to ignore any references you don't get. Many of them are more self-contained than you might realize.
2. Keep an eye out for a title that is new or starting over at #1 and get in on the ground floor.
3. Go to your local comic shop and chat with the employees about what you like and dislike. They'll recommend a place to start.
4. Read comics that are NOT Marvel or DC. There are a ton of other comics out there by other companies. Many of them are one-shots or completed series that you can buy all at once and just read end-to-end. Even the ones that are ongoing titles often exist each in their own universe, so you don't have to worry about learning so much backstory to enjoy one comic.

---

Just think up a few characters you find interesting and jump right in. DC is often more merciful with their jumping on points than Marvel, but just picking up the first issue of any writer's comic run will likely be a decent starting point. 

> I personally started with the New 52 and branched off from there and with Marvel I began with Hickman's New Avengers. If you've seen the animated shows and movies then you're already ahead of the curve in understanding the broad strokes of most comicbooks . 

---

The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

### Introduction to Comics

[How to Get Into Comic Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYnkpCfKuDw) (13:40) | Patrick Willems

**Consider your intent/commitment**. Think about your favorite shows, movies, books, etc. Reading primarily for enjoyment or encyclopedic knowledge? Collecting? Have the time/resources to read 50 or 500 comics per character?

**Don’t try to read everything at once**. There’s too much. Forget about catching up, continuity, universes, etc. for now. Older comics can be an acquired taste for modern audiences, so they aren’t necessarily ideal starting points. Writers change often, characters get re-worked, and origins are re-told. Remember, there are many great characters, creators, publishers, etc. to explore.

**Pick an interesting character/team and seek their most popular/acclaimed stories**. Focus on self-contained, complete stories in one corner of the universe. There will be unexplained references/characters, just persevere or Wiki. Don’t let the tangled web of shared-universe comics overwhelm you. Think of it like solving a jigsaw puzzle one small piece at a time until you finally see the big picture.

**Discover your preferences and let them guide you**. Don’t get stuck preparing/over-analyzing, just start reading. Do you like/dislike old/new comics? Specific writers/genres? Cartoony/realistic art? Familiar/weird concepts? References/self-contained? All-ages/mature content? Follow these instincts. Didn’t understand a reference? Maybe read that next.

**Discover your preferences and let them guide you**. Do you like: old/new comics? Specific genres? Literary/natural narratives? Cartoony/realistic art? Familiar/weird concepts? References/self-contained? Social/political commentary? Family-friendly/explicit content? Optimism/pessimism? Have you noticed that a specific artist/writer consistently makes comics you like? Follow these instincts.

Okay, so does your town have a library? (NO) Most libraries in English-speaking countries have a decent supply of graphic novels and other books collecting comics. That's a good place to start.

Alternatively, you can order comics to be delivered to you online, or buy book collections from online book stores.

ALTERNATIVELY, Marvel has a program called **Marvel Comics Unlimited**, which allows you to pay a monthly fee and get access to almost every Marvel comic out there, except for books made in the last six months.

Alternatively to that, Comixology allows you to buy individual comics or collections digitally.

> So the trick is that libraries borrow books from each other, so you can ask a librarian from your small library to get you books from the nearest local city's library in most cases.
>
> Now, the trick is that NO ONE has read every single issue. It's not like a TV show where they expect you to go on a Netflix binge and watch all the previous seasons. In general, superhero comics tend to have brand new starts every time a new writer takes over. They might call back to previous comics on occasion, but they will generally make it so that if you pick up the first comic by a new writer, you can follow along.
>
> You're never going to get caught up, there's just too much, but you can jump on the train and enjoy the rest of the journey.

I buy a lot of my books online, or you can read them digitally. Marvel have a service called **Marvel Unlimited** which is like Netflix for comics, you pay $9.99 I believe and it gives you access to thousands of comics, up to 6 months ago.

They have sections in the app tailored around the best stories for certain characters, they're usually focused on stories that are quite accessible.

The best thing to try and remember is that comics may seem overwhelming, but in truth they're not. Whenever a new writer starts on a comic it's usually seen as a blank slate for stories and so the best places to jump on. If a writer has been on a comic for years then there are usually suitable places for new people to start.

Comics can seem overburdened with history and characters, but as long as you give yourself time to understand them, it'll all work out fine. Plus, if there's ever anything you don't know or want to know more about there are plenty of wikis or this place that'd clear things up.

Personally, I really liked the Daredevil series from 1998-2011, as well as some of Frank Miller's Daredevil run. Don't read as much Marvel as I would like besides DD, but I liked the Messiah Complex/Messiah War in X-Men and didn't think Bendis' Age of Ultron was half bad. The Civil War arc was pretty good too, but it would be wise to learn a bit more about Marvel characters before reading it.

I mostly read DC. The New 52 stuff was just the easiest for me to start with. If you're starting there as well, I'd recommend beginning with the New 52 Justice League- That kind of hosted the main storyline for the New 52 (correct me if I'm wrong). Darkest Night, Crisis on Infinite Earths/Infinite Crisis, Flashpoint, and Kightfall are pretty major storylines too (And do I even have to mention The Killing Joke?). Batman is among my favorite DC characters to read, and I really enjoyed the whole saga of Batman: No Man's Land (Although it wasn't really about Batman for much of it). Also a few stories from Legends of the Dark Knight that I liked, stuff like *Going Sane*. Also liked the Red Lanterns (New 52 and the Nightwing series from 1996-2009.

## DC Universe

### Various starting points

[Source](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/).

#### The Beginning

If you want the most complete look at the DC Universe there is really only one place to start, way back at the beginning. Honestly this isn’t recommended for everyone. If you choose this you will experience all the events and learn about all the characters but it comes at the cost of reading thousands and thousands of issues. If this is what you want to do we have you covered. Just head to the **[DC Master Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order/)** and start reading.

An alternative to reading everything in the Master reading order would be to choose the characters you are interested in and reading their individual Character Reading Orders up to one of the other Starting Points and then continuing on from there.

#### Crisis

One of the unique features of the DC Universe is the Crisis events. These are events with major consequences for the entire DC multiverse and usually there is a new status quo after each event.

- [**Crisis on Infinite Earths**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/crisis-on-infinite-earths-reading-order/)
- [**Zero Hour: Crisis in Time**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/zero-hour-reading-order/)
- [**Infinite Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/infinite-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Final Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/final-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Flashpoint**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/flashpoint-reading-order/)
- [**Convergence**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/convergence-reading-order/)

#### Post-Crisis

**Crisis on Infinite Earths** in 1985 serves an an endpoint to the Golden and Silver Age DC comics. When you hear the terms Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis this is the event people are referring to. After the event all characters were given new and updated origin stories. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 2](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-2/)** and begin reading.

#### Infinite Crisis

**The Infinite Crisis** event in 2005 is a sequel to **Crisis on Infinite Earths** and the aftermath of the event is a good place to start reading. After the event all series skip forward a year and begin telling new stories. You can read the series 52 that fills in the gap between the event and the One Year Later stories. If this is where you want to start reading head to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 6](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-6/)** and begin reading after Infinite Crisis.

Optionally you could start reading before the Infinite Crisis event starting with Identity Crisis and continuing with Countdown to Infinite Crisis.

#### New 52

The New 52 was a line-wide relaunch of every DC Comic in 2011. This relaunch was specifically designed to provide new readers with a place to start reading. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[New 52 Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/new-52-reading-order/)** and begin reading.

#### DC Rebirth

The latest jumping on point is DC Rebirth. All series were relaunched with the intent to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the “**Flashpoint**” event, while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52. If this is where you want to begin then head over to the [DC Rebirth Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-rebirth-reading-order/) and start reading.

## Shops

[Comic Shop Locator](https://www.comicshoplocator.com/Home/1/1/57/575) - I don't think it works properly for Ukraine.

World:

- [**mycomicshop**](https://www.mycomicshop.com/) (Great store!), [midtowncomics](http://www.midtowncomics.com/) (mixed opinions on this one), [DCBS](https://www.dcbservice.com/), [local store](http://www.comicshoplocator.com/) - print (<u>singles</u>).

  > MyComicShop always does me right on grading and over-protecting for shipping. I've had the worst luck with Midtown. They're awesome! They may be a little pricier, but the books I get from here are ALWAYS in great condition and packaged extremely securely. Plus, they have some out of print stuff the others won't have.
  >
  > DCBS is great for preordering comicbooks in advance for a cheaper price. It's more worth it if you plan on buying a bunch at a time as you save more.

- [**instocktrades**](http://www.instocktrades.com/) (Great store!), [ISBNS](http://www.isbns.net/), library (free) - print (<u>collected editions</u>).

  > instocktrades is great for purchasing *trades*, which are collected issues into one big volume. (Instead of buying individual issues #1-#12, you just buy a trade which has them all in it).
  >
  > instocktrades: it may be worth it to trade wait if you are going to order everything online, and if that is the case instocktrades is great. It’s free shipping if you order $50 or more and you get an extra 2% off on your next order, so plan accordingly if you want to make a big order. Everything is usually discounted there too, so you can get a lot for that $50. They only sell trades, but I recommended trade waiting because it’s hard to order floppies every week due to cost. Unless your pull list is huge, to save money or spend the same amount on floppies as you would in store usually means you have to wait to order things anyhow. I have to be cost conscious and switching to trade waiting ended up making more sense for me; I might not have made that clear in my post, but I was throwing it out there as a cost-efficient option.

Additionally, their prices are frequently better for digital collected editions than one can find on ComiXology, but not always.

## Best Youtube channels about comics

10: *Nerdsync* and *comicstorian* is pretty good, although *comics explained* and **comic pop** are my favorites.

10: **Strip Panel Naked** is amazing for analyzing various tropes and techniques in comics. Panel X Panel is a digital magazine edited by the same guy, and it's also great.

8: **Comic Pop** is my favorite. Channel is very friendly and has great discussions about comics

5: Gem Mint is great.

5: Linkara-atopthefourthwall was my first comic channel and is still really good.

**Comicpop** is one I have gotten into recently and pretty good.

4: As others have said, **Comic Pop** is the best, with their show Back Issues being my favorite series of theirs.

> 4 (OP): Yeah! I love finishing a comic and then hopping on their Back Issue video to hear their discussion on it

3: Variant comics, *Comicstorian*, ComicDrake, and *ComicsExplained* are all great.

---

20: *Comic tropes* and cartoonist kayfabe are my two favorite

4: **ComicPOP**

5: The comic book palace

6: Comic Book University does a review of loads of comics every week with explanations of the plot etc. Was my go-to during HOX/ POX

5: **Comic Pop**

*Comic Tropes*

*Comicstorian*

and *Comics Explained*.

3: **Strip Panel Naked** has lots of brilliant in depth analysis of comic art

> 3: It's the best comics channel on YouTube.

---

43: **ComicPop**!

26: **Strip Panel Naked**. That channel is so good. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJAToPH5GSGShP7Yoc3jsA/featured

12: The weekly pull is for me, the best comic channel by a far margin.

If you know Spanish, Baf comics is also really fun

10: Professor Thorgi

*Caped Joel*

Everyone else has already listed the other ones I watch.

5: *Capedjoel* and **ComicPop** are both great channels.

6: *NerdSync* is my favorite

4: Lesser known channels that I've enjoyed over the last year (all of them are pretty chill/comfy):

[Nerdventures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyAbg740zC1rZkdoZqaMrVA/videos)

[earl grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZtauWih38Lr1aVEXuZybw/videos)

[Walt's Comic Book Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtZB7GGyYVrLnzXlooiS8mg/videos)

[Gore Vidal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCohnKPl88GFUqX-t3ZLU6zg/videos)

[sleepyreader666](https://www.youtube.com/user/sleepyreader666/videos)

3: *Comics explained* is pretty good

3: Atop the 4th Wall

---

12: **ComicPop** is my favorite!

9: For me there's really only two that I love.

**Strip Panel Naked** is a fantastic series that focuses on specific pages and panels from comics to analyze how writers, illustrators, inkers, colourists, and letterers tell stories. Really great exploration of comics as an art form and story telling medium. The creator (I think Hass?) is widely read and seriously knows comics.

The other is earl grey's panellogy. He's a European comic enthusiast with a wonderfully diverse collection and gives a really nice overview of different comic series that you've probably never even heard of. I've discovered some absolute gems thanks to his videos. He really has impeccable taste and a casual, intimate vibe.

Every other YouTube channel I've seen is usually just like **ComicPop** where it focuses nearly exclusively on Marvel and DC and has an artificial 'casual hang out' production style that is really offputting to me.

6: Are you looking for reviews, story breakdowns, or a more nuanced breakdown?

The best comic book youtuber is **Strip Panel Naked**, but they more cover the artistic side of how they are made, and less about current stories.

For reviews and story breakdowns, I enjoy **ComicPop**!, *Caped Joel*, *Comicstorian*, and *Comics Explained*.

5: **Strip panel naked** and *Nerdsync*

3: Variant is pretty solid.

4: I like *Comics Explained*, that's the main one for me, though looking around this thread I might start watching some other channels too.

### Conclusion

Best channels: **ComicPop** (with their show Back Issues), **Strip Panel Naked** (in-depth analysis of comic art), *Comicstorian*, *Caped Joel*, *Comic tropes*, *Comics Explained*(?), *Nerdsync*(?), Linkara-AtopTheFourthWall , Earl Grey's panellogy, Cartoonist Kayfabe.
