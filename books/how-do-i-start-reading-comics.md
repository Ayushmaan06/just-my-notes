# How do I start reading comics?

## Answers

Four options I've heard recommended:

1. Pick one of the major storylines or special events and get the collected version that has most/all of the issues that were involved. Read that, and try to ignore any references you don't get. Many of them are more self-contained than you might realize.
2. Keep an eye out for a title that is new or starting over at #1 and get in on the ground floor.
3. Go to your local comic shop and chat with the employees about what you like and dislike. They'll recommend a place to start.
4. Read comics that are NOT Marvel or DC. There are a ton of other comics out there by other companies. Many of them are one-shots or completed series that you can buy all at once and just read end-to-end. Even the ones that are ongoing titles often exist each in their own universe, so you don't have to worry about learning so much backstory to enjoy one comic.

Just think up a few characters you find interesting and jump right in. DC is often more merciful with their jumping on points than Marvel, but just picking up the first issue of any writer's comic run will likely be a decent starting point. 

> I personally started with the New 52 and branched off from there and with Marvel I began with Hickman's New Avengers. If you've seen the animated shows and movies then you're already ahead of the curve in understanding the broad strokes of most comicbooks .

Personally, I really liked the Daredevil series from 1998-2011, as well as some of Frank Miller's Daredevil run. Don't read as much Marvel as I would like besides DD, but I liked the Messiah Complex/Messiah War in X-Men and didn't think Bendis' Age of Ultron was half bad. The Civil War arc was pretty good too, but it would be wise to learn a bit more about Marvel characters before reading it.

I mostly read DC. The New 52 stuff was just the easiest for me to start with. If you're starting there as well, I'd recommend beginning with the New 52 Justice League- That kind of hosted the main storyline for the New 52 (correct me if I'm wrong). Darkest Night, Crisis on Infinite Earths/Infinite Crisis, Flashpoint, and Kightfall are pretty major storylines too (And do I even have to mention The Killing Joke?). Batman is among my favorite DC characters to read, and I really enjoyed the whole saga of Batman: No Man's Land (Although it wasn't really about Batman for much of it). Also a few stories from Legends of the Dark Knight that I liked, stuff like *Going Sane*. Also liked the Red Lanterns (New 52 and the Nightwing series from 1996-2009.

World:

- [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Comics-Graphic-Novels-Books/b?ie=UTF8&node=4366). Note that Amazon also has a large selection of digital comics, and most of them link to your ComiXology account if you have one--it'll say whether or not this is the case on each comic's page. Additionally, their prices are frequently better for digital collected editions than one can find on ComiXology, but not always.
