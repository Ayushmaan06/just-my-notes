## Recommendations

Four options I've heard recommended:

1. Pick one of the major storylines or special events and get the collected version that has most/all of the issues that were involved. Read that, and try to ignore any references you don't get. Many of them are more self-contained than you might realize.
2. Keep an eye out for a title that is new or starting over at #1 and get in on the ground floor.
3. Go to your local comic shop and chat with the employees about what you like and dislike. They'll recommend a place to start.
4. Read comics that are NOT Marvel or DC. There are a ton of other comics out there by other companies. Many of them are one-shots or completed series that you can buy all at once and just read end-to-end. Even the ones that are ongoing titles often exist each in their own universe, so you don't have to worry about learning so much backstory to enjoy one comic.

---

Just think up a few characters you find interesting and jump right in. DC is often more merciful with their jumping on points than Marvel, but just picking up the first issue of any writer's comic run will likely be a decent starting point. 

> I personally started with the New 52 and branched off from there and with Marvel I began with Hickman's New Avengers. If you've seen the animated shows and movies then you're already ahead of the curve in understanding the broad strokes of most comicbooks .

The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

### Introduction to Comics

[How to Get Into Comic Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYnkpCfKuDw) (13:40) | Patrick Willems

**Consider your intent/commitment**. Think about your favorite shows, movies, books, etc. Reading primarily for enjoyment or encyclopedic knowledge? Collecting? Have the time/resources to read 50 or 500 comics per character?

**Don’t try to read everything at once**. There’s too much. Forget about catching up, continuity, universes, etc. for now. Older comics can be an acquired taste for modern audiences, so they aren’t necessarily ideal starting points. Writers change often, characters get re-worked, and origins are re-told. Remember, there are many great characters, creators, publishers, etc. to explore.

**Pick an interesting character/team and seek their most popular/acclaimed stories**. Focus on self-contained, complete stories in one corner of the universe. There will be unexplained references/characters, just persevere or Wiki. Don’t let the tangled web of shared-universe comics overwhelm you. Think of it like solving a jigsaw puzzle one small piece at a time until you finally see the big picture.

**Discover your preferences and let them guide you**. Don’t get stuck preparing/over-analyzing, just start reading. Do you like/dislike old/new comics? Specific writers/genres? Cartoony/realistic art? Familiar/weird concepts? References/self-contained? All-ages/mature content? Follow these instincts. Didn’t understand a reference? Maybe read that next.

**Discover your preferences and let them guide you**. Do you like: old/new comics? Specific genres? Literary/natural narratives? Cartoony/realistic art? Familiar/weird concepts? References/self-contained? Social/political commentary? Family-friendly/explicit content? Optimism/pessimism? Have you noticed that a specific artist/writer consistently makes comics you like? Follow these instincts.

Okay, so does your town have a library? (NO) Most libraries in English-speaking countries have a decent supply of graphic novels and other books collecting comics. That's a good place to start.

Alternatively, you can order comics to be delivered to you online, or buy book collections from online book stores.

ALTERNATIVELY, Marvel has a program called **Marvel Comics Unlimited**, which allows you to pay a monthly fee and get access to almost every Marvel comic out there, except for books made in the last six months.

Alternatively to that, Comixology allows you to buy individual comics or collections digitally.

> So the trick is that libraries borrow books from each other, so you can ask a librarian from your small library to get you books from the nearest local city's library in most cases.
>
> Now, the trick is that NO ONE has read every single issue. It's not like a TV show where they expect you to go on a Netflix binge and watch all the previous seasons. In general, superhero comics tend to have brand new starts every time a new writer takes over. They might call back to previous comics on occasion, but they will generally make it so that if you pick up the first comic by a new writer, you can follow along.
>
> You're never going to get caught up, there's just too much, but you can jump on the train and enjoy the rest of the journey.

I buy a lot of my books online, or you can read them digitally. Marvel have a service called **Marvel Unlimited** which is like Netflix for comics, you pay $9.99 I believe and it gives you access to thousands of comics, up to 6 months ago.

They have sections in the app tailored around the best stories for certain characters, they're usually focused on stories that are quite accessible.

The best thing to try and remember is that comics may seem overwhelming, but in truth they're not. Whenever a new writer starts on a comic it's usually seen as a blank slate for stories and so the best places to jump on. If a writer has been on a comic for years then there are usually suitable places for new people to start.

Comics can seem overburdened with history and characters, but as long as you give yourself time to understand them, it'll all work out fine. Plus, if there's ever anything you don't know or want to know more about there are plenty of wikis or this place that'd clear things up.

Personally, I really liked the Daredevil series from 1998-2011, as well as some of Frank Miller's Daredevil run. Don't read as much Marvel as I would like besides DD, but I liked the Messiah Complex/Messiah War in X-Men and didn't think Bendis' Age of Ultron was half bad. The Civil War arc was pretty good too, but it would be wise to learn a bit more about Marvel characters before reading it.

I mostly read DC. The New 52 stuff was just the easiest for me to start with. If you're starting there as well, I'd recommend beginning with the New 52 Justice League- That kind of hosted the main storyline for the New 52 (correct me if I'm wrong). Darkest Night, Crisis on Infinite Earths/Infinite Crisis, Flashpoint, and Kightfall are pretty major storylines too (And do I even have to mention The Killing Joke?). Batman is among my favorite DC characters to read, and I really enjoyed the whole saga of Batman: No Man's Land (Although it wasn't really about Batman for much of it). Also a few stories from Legends of the Dark Knight that I liked, stuff like *Going Sane*. Also liked the Red Lanterns (New 52 and the Nightwing series from 1996-2009.

## DC Universe

### Various starting points

[Source](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/).

#### The Beginning

If you want the most complete look at the DC Universe there is really only one place to start, way back at the beginning. Honestly this isn’t recommended for everyone. If you choose this you will experience all the events and learn about all the characters but it comes at the cost of reading thousands and thousands of issues. If this is what you want to do we have you covered. Just head to the **[DC Master Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order/)** and start reading.

An alternative to reading everything in the Master reading order would be to choose the characters you are interested in and reading their individual Character Reading Orders up to one of the other Starting Points and then continuing on from there.

#### Crisis

One of the unique features of the DC Universe is the Crisis events. These are events with major consequences for the entire DC multiverse and usually there is a new status quo after each event.

- [**Crisis on Infinite Earths**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/crisis-on-infinite-earths-reading-order/)
- [**Zero Hour: Crisis in Time**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/zero-hour-reading-order/)
- [**Infinite Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/infinite-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Final Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/final-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Flashpoint**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/flashpoint-reading-order/)
- [**Convergence**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/convergence-reading-order/)

#### Post-Crisis

**Crisis on Infinite Earths** in 1985 serves an an endpoint to the Golden and Silver Age DC comics. When you hear the terms Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis this is the event people are referring to. After the event all characters were given new and updated origin stories. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 2](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-2/)** and begin reading.

#### Infinite Crisis

**The Infinite Crisis** event in 2005 is a sequel to **Crisis on Infinite Earths** and the aftermath of the event is a good place to start reading. After the event all series skip forward a year and begin telling new stories. You can read the series 52 that fills in the gap between the event and the One Year Later stories. If this is where you want to start reading head to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 6](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-6/)** and begin reading after Infinite Crisis.

Optionally you could start reading before the Infinite Crisis event starting with Identity Crisis and continuing with Countdown to Infinite Crisis.

#### New 52

The New 52 was a line-wide relaunch of every DC Comic in 2011. This relaunch was specifically designed to provide new readers with a place to start reading. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[New 52 Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/new-52-reading-order/)** and begin reading.

#### DC Rebirth

The latest jumping on point is DC Rebirth. All series were relaunched with the intent to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the “**Flashpoint**” event, while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52. If this is where you want to begin then head over to the [DC Rebirth Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-rebirth-reading-order/) and start reading.

Additionally, their prices are frequently better for digital collected editions than one can find on ComiXology, but not always.
