## Recommendations

Four options I've heard recommended:

1. Pick one of the major storylines or special events and get the collected version that has most/all of the issues that were involved. Read that, and try to ignore any references you don't get. Many of them are more self-contained than you might realize.
2. Keep an eye out for a title that is new or starting over at #1 and get in on the ground floor.
3. Go to your local comic shop and chat with the employees about what you like and dislike. They'll recommend a place to start.
4. Read comics that are NOT Marvel or DC. There are a ton of other comics out there by other companies. Many of them are one-shots or completed series that you can buy all at once and just read end-to-end. Even the ones that are ongoing titles often exist each in their own universe, so you don't have to worry about learning so much backstory to enjoy one comic.

---

Just think up a few characters you find interesting and jump right in. DC is often more merciful with their jumping on points than Marvel, but just picking up the first issue of any writer's comic run will likely be a decent starting point. 

> I personally started with the New 52 and branched off from there and with Marvel I began with Hickman's New Avengers. If you've seen the animated shows and movies then you're already ahead of the curve in understanding the broad strokes of most comicbooks .

The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

### Introduction to Comics

[How to Get Into Comic Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYnkpCfKuDw) (13:40) | Patrick Willems

**Consider your intent/commitment**. Think about your favorite shows, movies, books, etc. Reading primarily for enjoyment or encyclopedic knowledge? Collecting? Have the time/resources to read 50 or 500 comics per character?

**Don’t try to read everything at once**. There’s too much. Forget about catching up, continuity, universes, etc. for now. Older comics can be an acquired taste for modern audiences, so they aren’t necessarily ideal starting points. Writers change often, characters get re-worked, and origins are re-told. Remember, there are many great characters, creators, publishers, etc. to explore.

**Pick an interesting character/team and seek their most popular/acclaimed stories**. Focus on self-contained, complete stories in one corner of the universe. There will be unexplained references/characters, just persevere or Wiki. Don’t let the tangled web of shared-universe comics overwhelm you. Think of it like solving a jigsaw puzzle one small piece at a time until you finally see the big picture.

**Discover your preferences and let them guide you**. Don’t get stuck preparing/over-analyzing, just start reading. Do you like/dislike old/new comics? Specific writers/genres? Cartoony/realistic art? Familiar/weird concepts? References/self-contained? All-ages/mature content? Follow these instincts. Didn’t understand a reference? Maybe read that next.

Okay, so does your town have a library? (NO) Most libraries in English-speaking countries have a decent supply of graphic novels and other books collecting comics. That's a good place to start.

Alternatively, you can order comics to be delivered to you online, or buy book collections from online book stores.

ALTERNATIVELY, Marvel has a program called **Marvel Comics Unlimited**, which allows you to pay a monthly fee and get access to almost every Marvel comic out there, except for books made in the last six months.

Alternatively to that, Comixology allows you to buy individual comics or collections digitally.

> So the trick is that libraries borrow books from each other, so you can ask a librarian from your small library to get you books from the nearest local city's library in most cases.
>
> Now, the trick is that NO ONE has read every single issue. It's not like a TV show where they expect you to go on a Netflix binge and watch all the previous seasons. In general, superhero comics tend to have brand new starts every time a new writer takes over. They might call back to previous comics on occasion, but they will generally make it so that if you pick up the first comic by a new writer, you can follow along.
>
> You're never going to get caught up, there's just too much, but you can jump on the train and enjoy the rest of the journey.

I buy a lot of my books online, or you can read them digitally. Marvel have a service called **Marvel Unlimited** which is like Netflix for comics, you pay $9.99 I believe and it gives you access to thousands of comics, up to 6 months ago.

They have sections in the app tailored around the best stories for certain characters, they're usually focused on stories that are quite accessible.

The best thing to try and remember is that comics may seem overwhelming, but in truth they're not. Whenever a new writer starts on a comic it's usually seen as a blank slate for stories and so the best places to jump on. If a writer has been on a comic for years then there are usually suitable places for new people to start.

Comics can seem overburdened with history and characters, but as long as you give yourself time to understand them, it'll all work out fine. Plus, if there's ever anything you don't know or want to know more about there are plenty of wikis or this place that'd clear things up.

Personally, I really liked the Daredevil series from 1998-2011, as well as some of Frank Miller's Daredevil run. Don't read as much Marvel as I would like besides DD, but I liked the Messiah Complex/Messiah War in X-Men and didn't think Bendis' Age of Ultron was half bad. The Civil War arc was pretty good too, but it would be wise to learn a bit more about Marvel characters before reading it.

I mostly read DC. The New 52 stuff was just the easiest for me to start with. If you're starting there as well, I'd recommend beginning with the New 52 Justice League- That kind of hosted the main storyline for the New 52 (correct me if I'm wrong). Darkest Night, Crisis on Infinite Earths/Infinite Crisis, Flashpoint, and Kightfall are pretty major storylines too (And do I even have to mention The Killing Joke?). Batman is among my favorite DC characters to read, and I really enjoyed the whole saga of Batman: No Man's Land (Although it wasn't really about Batman for much of it). Also a few stories from Legends of the Dark Knight that I liked, stuff like *Going Sane*. Also liked the Red Lanterns (New 52 and the Nightwing series from 1996-2009.

## DC Universe

### Various starting points

[Source](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/).

#### The Beginning

If you want the most complete look at the DC Universe there is really only one place to start, way back at the beginning. Honestly this isn’t recommended for everyone. If you choose this you will experience all the events and learn about all the characters but it comes at the cost of reading thousands and thousands of issues. If this is what you want to do we have you covered. Just head to the **[DC Master Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order/)** and start reading.

An alternative to reading everything in the Master reading order would be to choose the characters you are interested in and reading their individual Character Reading Orders up to one of the other Starting Points and then continuing on from there.

#### Crisis

One of the unique features of the DC Universe is the Crisis events. These are events with major consequences for the entire DC multiverse and usually there is a new status quo after each event.

- [**Crisis on Infinite Earths**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/crisis-on-infinite-earths-reading-order/)
- [**Zero Hour: Crisis in Time**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/zero-hour-reading-order/)
- [**Infinite Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/infinite-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Final Crisis**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/final-crisis-reading-order/)
- [**Flashpoint**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/flashpoint-reading-order/)
- [**Convergence**](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/convergence-reading-order/)

#### Post-Crisis

**Crisis on Infinite Earths** in 1985 serves an an endpoint to the Golden and Silver Age DC comics. When you hear the terms Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis this is the event people are referring to. After the event all characters were given new and updated origin stories. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 2](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-2/)** and begin reading.

#### Infinite Crisis

**The Infinite Crisis** event in 2005 is a sequel to **Crisis on Infinite Earths** and the aftermath of the event is a good place to start reading. After the event all series skip forward a year and begin telling new stories. You can read the series 52 that fills in the gap between the event and the One Year Later stories. If this is where you want to start reading head to the **[DC Master Reading Order Part 6](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-master-reading-order-part-6/)** and begin reading after Infinite Crisis.

Optionally you could start reading before the Infinite Crisis event starting with Identity Crisis and continuing with Countdown to Infinite Crisis.

#### New 52

The New 52 was a line-wide relaunch of every DC Comic in 2011. This relaunch was specifically designed to provide new readers with a place to start reading. If this is where you want to start reading go to the **[New 52 Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/events/new-52-reading-order/)** and begin reading.

#### DC Rebirth

The latest jumping on point is DC Rebirth. All series were relaunched with the intent to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the “**Flashpoint**” event, while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52. If this is where you want to begin then head over to the [DC Rebirth Reading Order](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/dc-rebirth-reading-order/) and start reading.

### Opinions about New 52 and Rebirth

31: It sacrificed decades of character growth for a sales gimmick.

28: 

1. No one knew what was canon and what wasn’t because Batman and GL were in the middle of definitive runs and were selling well, so they didn’t get rebooted at all, but the reboot meant none of their past stories made sense now
2. All of Lee’s buddies seemed to get jobs they didn’t deserve like Liefeld
3. Good creative talent kept leaving because of clashes with editorial like Lemire, Diggle, Cornell, etc
4. A lot of legacy heroes got screwed like Wally West, Tim Drake, Conner Kent, usually acting so different they might as well have been different characters
5. The main characters were changed pretty radically in some ways. Sometimes it worked out like with (imo) Azz WW and Morrison Superman, but even when it did work out, the following creative teams usually did a terrible job

There were still good, definitive runs though like Johns Aquaman or JL, or Snyder Batman. But they just got submerged beneath the tidal wave of crap, especially with DC launching a ton of #1’s all at once.

9: To me, New 52 is a distillation of everything I dislike about DC:

1. Overly edgey stories and ideas (Superman being a jerk and having his parents die in a car accident)
2. A Whatever approach to continuity ( Everything is reset except Batman and Green Lantern even though important DC events happen in Green Lantern and are hinged on Post-Crisis continuity, like Blackest Night)
3. Throwing out or killing legacy characters (Wally is gone, Tim Drake was never Robin or apart of the Bat-family)
4. It plays on an idea Marvel has beaten to death lately; high sales for new number 1s. It works temporarily but sales even out after a while

The real kicker is I started reading comics with New 52 Batman. I appreciate New 52 for being my entryway into comics but can see its glaring flaws.

7: It threw out a bunch of characters that a lot of fans love, or twisted their personalities and origins until they barely resembled themselves.

There were some good things that came out of the New 52 but ultimately it has done far more harm than good. It doesn't help that the damage seems to be permanent at this point :(.

6: It wasn’t a complete reboot. The theory was that everyone got much younger, yet Batman still had all of his family (bar Cass Cain and Steph Brown) and GL still had most of his history intact.

Superman got a complete shaft by being written as more of an arrogant man with no semblance of pre-Flashpoint personality and his parents died because of something Superman could prevent, instead of the heart attack that took Jonathan Kent instead.

Many of the romances and relationships that defined the DC Universe were also phased out of existence, the most notable being Lois and Clark (in favour of WW and Clark), Green Arrow and Black Canary (revisited in Rebirth), Barry and Iris (wasn’t even considered until Rebirth either, and much further down the line) and Wally and Linda Park (which STILL doesn’t even exist).

The history of the Titans and the Young Justice-era Teen Titans were also changed. Conner Kent, Tim Drake and Bart Allen were completely altered, with Conner and Bart missing until recently (Bart returned after Flash War and Conner is coming back soon) and Tim Drake immediately donning the Red Robin mantle instead of having a stint as a Robin himself. Starfire was part of the Outlaws and Beast Boy and Raven weren’t even around. Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal and Garth also seemingly had their own version of the team removed. The Justice Society and the Legion of Superheroes were also a no-show from my knowledge and many characters (Plastic Man, Hawkgirl, Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Wildcat, Dr Fate, Elongated Man, etc.) were missing until Rebirth, and some still are. Martian Manhunter, a member of the original seven, was considered an antihero for a while until he returned in Metal.

While the majority of the New 52 was hard to read (I started with Batman: Hush and the Meltzer JL run, but I started fully investing in the universe when the New 52 came out), some of it turned out great. Snyder’s Batman run, Morrison’s Action Comics, Azzarello’s Wonder Woman, Lemire’s Green Arrow, Geoff Johns’ revitalisations of the Justice League (leading to a culmination in Darkseid War) and Aquaman (setting new precedents and status quo for the character) and the Justice League Dark’s popularity. However, were these things worth the complete culling of DC’s known history up to that point? Absolutely not.

4: Legacy characters got fucked and there was some **BAD** writing

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight.

Even rebirth now is hitting some heavy lows.

2: I think the main reason is because it was so poorly planned. You could tell they had no real idea what they were doing and it just made a mess of things. Big things were set up and then just tossed to the side with no real payoff because they were constantly changing their minds on what they were doing. It just made things so sloppy. You would constantly see things brought up in one book that would contidicted in another because no one knew what was and wasn't part of the Nu52 cannon. This was especially bad on the books with teen characters like Titans since no one knew what the hell was going on with their new histories.

2: It was the time all the executives and editors in DC agreed that maybe the 90s weren't that bad after all.

---

18: Easily rebirth. There was so much trash in the 52. Rebirth is setting things right

8: Rebirth, by a long shot. N52 threw almost everything I cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

4: We had *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*, Animal Man by Jeff Lemire, Wonder Woman by Brian Azarello, Action Comics by Grant Morrison, Justice League by Geoff Johns, Aquaman by Geoff Johns, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, Batwoman by J H Williams.

Personally, that is why I would pick New 52 compared to Rebirth, it just feels like there were stronger titles and iconic storylines unlike Rebirth which feels more like a routine. Yeah, some will see the characters are better but where is the epic ? Where is the stuff that will make someone look back on it in 5 years and say " Damn, Rebirth was THE thing to read "

> 3: Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**.
>
> Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batwoman, Justice League, Bargirl - just to mention a few - had much stronger titles in the New 52. I became a big fan of both Batwoman and Aquaman because of their New 52 runs. If I had read their Rebirth run at the time instead I wouldn’t have been anywhere near as interested in them as I am now.

4: Gotta go with N52. Batman is my 2nd favorite hero of all time and *Snyder's run* was just plain f'cking epic. Tom King's has been meh to eh at best. Otherwise Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and I actually like that.

> 1: The New 52 Batman and New 52 Gl only benefitted from the new 52s darker tones.

4: Didn't New 52 Superman say guns are for sissies to an officer? How is that not being a confident, condescending dick? He didn't say he doesn't need them, he indirectly called all soldiers and cops sissies. Real down-to-earth class act. Just saying.

2: New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2.

2: New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the dc business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga.

---

12: DC New 52 was the Reboot of Comics continuity that started in 2011. It de-aged, rewrote, and threw out a lot classic stories to attract new readers and start from scratch. It officially lasted until 2015, where the books went through a brief "creator orientated" period, that saw many characters go through more apparent changes and stories (Green Lantern a criminal, Superman powerless, Jim Gordan as Batman). The overall consensus of The New 52 was mixed, and a lot of people wanted the old Universe back, or at the very least, start making things like they were.

Rebirth was the 2016 initiation to do just that. Won't explain the story specific details, but know that a lot of characters that have been missing since the Reboot came back, Relationships and Costumes came back, and overall a sense of Time had passed that meant a lot of characters were married again.

Recommendations! *BATMAN: NEW 52 By Scott Snyder*. This is a 50 issue run and has its highs and lows, but this was the star of the New 52 for a while. It also acts as a great Satellite Book incase you want to jump over to The other Bat Family books.

*Geoff Johns's GREEN LANTERN Saga*. It's 10 years long, and it brought back the Green Lanterns into the spotlight.

Lois and Clark is a good one. All you need to know is that the Superman and Lois from the old Universe, before the Reboot, have made it to the new one and are living it out in secret, Raising their son.

GRAYSON. First Robin, Formerly Nightwing, Now secret Agent. Dick Grayson must go undercover and attempt to figure out what plans SPYRAL have. Very fun read.

TITANS HUNT (2015). It's one of the DC Books between New 52 and Rebirth, and basically brings back the Original Titan members again.

THE FINAL DAYS OF SUPERMAN.

DC UNIVERSE REBIRTH SPECIAL. This is where it begins. it's a massive 80 page one shot that sets up the Future of the DC Universe and what Rebirth has in store.

For Rebirth, I would suggest the following (NOTE: Pick up "Title Name": Rebirth and then the main title with the Rebirth banner)

SUPERMAN

TITANS (not Teen)

GREEN ARROW

RED HOOD AND THE OUTLAWS

HAL JORDAN AND THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS

WONDER WOMAN

DEATHSTROKE

Alternatively, if 10 years of Green Lantern is too much for you, you could instead go with GREEN LANTERNS (2016). It's meant as a jumping off point for new readers who don't know a lot about the Lantern mythos. Plus, 2 rookie lanterns!

6: I'd say the *New52* was a much harder reboot than *Rebirth* was. Characters like Superman and Wonder Woman, got all new backstories, and stories were erased from continuity. It was kinda a mess. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision.

*Rebirth* is about bringing back aspects of the pre-*Flashpoint* continuity, while altering character's continuity and backstories (such as Superman, Deathstroke and Wonder Woman).

---

6: The answer for all entertainment medium consumption is:

1. If you have the time, consume everything in release order.
2. If you don't have the time, consume only the "best" in release order.

I wouldn't think of it as New 52 versus Rebirth. Just read the best titles of each:

- [**Rebirth** Recommended Reading Survey Results](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV)

2: Skip to Rebirth.

> Well Rebirth is often undo what New 52 created. So if choose to read N52, you are probably read a story has been [retcon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=retcon) or has status it never happen.

8: Continuity wise, you could read the Rebirth books and be fine (it's meant to be a jumping on point for new readers anyway), but there are definitely some New 52 titles worth reading imo.

*Batman*, Batman and Robin, Grayson, Omega Men, Justice League, and *Swamp Thing* are all worth reading from the New 52.

---

18: Start anywhere you want. If you encounter something confusing, either keep reading comics until it makes sense or Google it. Here are some rankings of newer comics:

[Rebirth](https://imgur.com/x8lMwAV) survey results (May 2017).

[New 52](http://imgur.com/Rhq72HB) survey results (February 2014).

8: Except for *Batman* and *Green Lantern*, "Rebirth" is more trur to DC characters, so I would start with Rebirth.

4: New 52 *Batman* and *Green Lantern* yes. Jeff Lemire's Green Arrow yes. Damian By Tomasi yes. Superman Lois and Clark yes. I would also check out Omega Men. There might be some others from the N52 era I am missing.

Rebirth has been killer top to bottom for the most part. The stuff I am reading is Superman from Tomasi, Super Sons from Tomasi, Green Arrow, Batman, Green Lanterns, All Star Batman. Only major complaint I have is that some stories are slow moving. Trinity, Justice League. For example.

6: Rebirth, no doubt. New 52 made me dislike reading DC comics. However, "Death of the Family" and "Night of the Owls" are amazing reads, you should check it out.

> 13: The New 52 Flash series (when Francis Manapul was on it) was REALLY good. As was *Scott Snyder's entire Batman run*, Geoff Johns Justice League run, King's Grayson, etc. And I can't forget John's Aqusman run, which helped redefine the character for a new age.

> The New 52 had a lot of bad (Like Teen Titans), but it also had a lot of good and great stories. It helped get A LOT of people back into comics, and DC wouldn't have the success it has now with Rebirth w/o it 
>
> > 3: I was surprised with how good Aquaman and Flash were. Unpopular opinion: Blue Beetle, Green Arrow and Batwing were actually decent (which was something I wasn't expecting). On the other hand, series like Teen Titans, Red Hood, Batwoman and many more were so disappointing...

3: The best thing in the New 52, hands down, was Brian Azarello's Wonder Woman. Other things are hit and miss. The DCYou stuff starting about 30 issues in got a bit better (Commish Gordon as a reluctant Batman was fun af).

Rebirth is all pretty good.

2: This is how i got into comics...

I would start with the New 52 but only the very best titles:

Aquaman by Geoff Johns

The Flash by Francis Manapul

*Batman by Scott Snyder*

*Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*

And maybe some other like Wonder Woman by Brian Azzarello and Justice League by Geoff Johns if you want.

Then if any of those characters in those stories interest you, i would go back and read some of their best Pre-Flashpoint stories.

Once you have done this i would start reading Rebirth. You can however, go straight from the New 52 to Rebirth and enjoy the great stuff Rebirth has been putting out so far but i will say that Rebirth (while great on its own) does not have nearly as big of an impact as it does if you know some of the Pre-Flashpoint history and characters (that doesnt mean all of it by any means as i know that might sound daunting but just some).

2: This is very good guide with best starting points and breef explanations of each one: https://comicbookreadingorders.com/dc/

1: Depends on who you want to start with. If you like Batman, his New 52 stories were pretty much all good so you could start there. If you wanted to start with someone like Superman or Green Arrow, then I would suggest starting with Rebirth because their N52 stories were a little shaky in terms of quality.

1: I'd say read *New 52 Batman*, GL, Flash, Forever Evil, and Grayson.

1: Rebirth but the New 52 might be worth reading for its Batman series.

1: Dedicate yourself to rebirth however go back and read some of the most popular stories from New 52.

Scott Synders batman run and Geoff John's Aquaman run are some of the best reads you can ask for.

1: Rebirth overall seems to be slightly higher quality. But n52 had a lot of great titles. For me *Swamp Thing* is a MUST read. Animal Man alongside it is great also. *Batman*, Action Comics, Wonder Woman and Flash were all solid and Justice League is good fun too!

#### Conclusion

##### General consensus on New 52

This was a mess. New 52 had the right idea in trying to do a new golden age or a new silver age. What failed was the DC business model which failed to find new customers and failed to make comics mainstream like manga. It's clear there wasn't enough communication between the writers, and there was no clear vision. Many characters were been defaced and reworked, many cool characters from the previous runs were deleted from the continuous such as Wally West. Plus, there was some **BAD** writing. 

But it wasn't all bad, there was a lot of potential that got squandered by editorial/poor foresight. Although, some runs and books are worth attention: *Batman by Scott Snyder*, *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns*, *Swamp Thing by Scott Snyder*. People say strange thing about New 52 Batman (Gordon as Batman, what?), but they also say that it's well written. By the way, many people say that New 52 is more darker than Rebirth.

##### General consensus on Rebirth

In general, it is was a step in right direction. DC continued New 52, but they returned old comic book spirit. N52 threw almost everything people cared about in the garbage. Rebirth brought it back in really fun ways.

Story wise New 52 was much better. A lot of the writing in the Rebirth has been completely lazy. They put a lazy storyline and then give a “throw back to the roots” moment and every one - old fans - think it’s the best thing. **Rebirth gets the readers by nostalgia**. New 52 had more GREAT books, but Rebirth is more consistent. Overall there isn't a huge difference between the 2. Rebirth seems to have gone back to a more light hearted "that's the bad guy lets punch him in the face!" style of story and some people actually like that which I don't like.

---

So, I will definitely read the best runs and stories from the New 52, but I don't think I will like Rebirth. According to the words, it sounds like a fan service.
