# Best sites for self-study

## Programming and Computer Science

According to Reddit:

> **TL;DR**
>
> Coursera (advanced,  trainers are knowledgeable experienced and deliver up to the mark)> EDX (beginner, sometimes this one is better than Coursera) > Khan Academy (math, programming, good)> Udacity (there are some bad nanodegree courses, bad free courses) > Udemy (beginner, bad paid courses despite 4.5+ ratings).
>
> Coursera, EDX, Udacity are more academic. The academic background may mean the course is a bit more intense, more mathematical, etc.

**Coursera**

- Majority of classes are paid, but they are monthly so if you complete them in a month you only pay a month
- A lot of content
- I think this is the best option once you do some beginner courses

**EDX**

- free
- low amount of content once you go above beginner
- I would start with this one with, since they have cs50, mit etc.

**Udacity**

- usually very expensive nanodegree programs, but you get mentorships, project reviews, project assignments
- only worth paying if you think above points are worth around 200$ a month
- single courses are free, but they often have no projects, i don't think they are that good, very barebones (exception being android course, which I know)

**Udemy**

- very beginner, no projects, handheld
- would rate lowest of them
- would use if having trouble with a concept and tried other sources, but still struggle

I would do edx for beginner and then coursera.

Also check stanford courses which are online and free. They have databases, algorithms etc.

Udacity has been moving away from the free content model for a few years now. However, their old courses are still available for free, but they are not being maintained nor updated.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is very educational and they teach almost every subject you can think of. Khan Academy teaches a lot of subjects, but their biggest focus is definitely <u>math</u>. As for programming, they cover HTML/CSS & Javascript - and that is about all they offer right now. They have some computer science classes as well, that teach like algorithms and databases.
