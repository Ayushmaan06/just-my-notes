## All spheres

30: **Lindsey Ellis**, also known as the Nostalgia Chick. Makes videos on <u>movies</u>, directors, editing, and history of film.

20: [**Every Frame a Painting**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A): unfortunately no longer active but has great videos on <u>film and editing</u>.

[MrBtongue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAJaOTL1BoipG41OmfyA): the guy who got me to start watching video essays in the first place. Not the greatest presentation but really interesting ideas.

[kaptainkristian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPgdqQKpq4T4zeqmTelnFg): my favorite presentation/editing, speaks to me personally as a person who grew up with Toonami and Adult Swim in the late 90s and early 00s.

[CaspianReport](https://www.youtube.com/user/CaspianReport/videos?disable_polymer=1): modern geopolitics and some recent history. He opened my eyes on many interesting topics in international politics such as the Iran-Saudi proxy war.

[*Core-A Gaming*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg/videos?disable_polymer=1): very niche topic of videos essays about competitive <u>Fighting Game E-Sports</u>.

[Noah Caldwell-Gervais](https://www.youtube.com/user/broadcaststsatic/videos?disable_polymer=1): rough/basic presentation but he goes extremely in-depth into the <u>games</u> he talks about. I mean he goes out of his way to finish every game (harder than it sounds) before he makes a video on them so his opinions are very well informed and often interesting to listen to. He also tends to play every single game in a series to completion in order to evaluate a series as a whole, which is really cool to see how a whole game series evolves through all its iterations.

[****Redlettermedia****](https://www.youtube.com/user/RedLetterMedia/videos?disable_polymer=1): they're not even focused on video essays. Half in the Bag is a bi-weekly movie review series, and Best of the Worst is more like a goofy Mystery Science Theater type thing. But their Plinkett Reviews are internet famous at this point, and each one they put out has quality ideas and great criticism. Their Ghostbusters 2016 review really wowed me in how succinctly it dissected how and why it failed as a reboot.

> 5: I want to second Noah. [His travel video essays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-naJR_rhkUM) are downright magical to me. How he weaves videogame commentary while talking about his experiences on the road and the various writers that have influenced not just his journey but his view on life is amazing.
>
> 4: **Noah Caldwell-Gervais** thirded, and the seconding the wonderful **MrBtongue** (when he does get around to making his videos!).

10: Checking in with:

[Sideways](https://youtu.be/i8HePfa7WYs)

[Gamedenker](https://youtu.be/oMGrx61ejKE)

[Big Joel](https://youtu.be/Le4hQDrIcsw)

8: [Polyphonic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXkNod_JcH7PleOjwK_8rYQ)

[kaptainkristian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPgdqQKpq4T4zeqmTelnFg)

[The Royal Ocean Film Society](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWq-qJSudqKrzquTVep9Jwg)

[Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1)

Not all Vox is good, but these are.

[Vox - Earworm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fyqfIwGjH2fYC5fFLfdwW4)

[Vox - Pop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5dOiUTzcsHU5ahmgcqjdIJx)

7: All of the people already posted, but I also thoroughly enjoy [Like Stories of Old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4etinsAy34)

4: Came here to second anything Vox does, second Nerdwriter, and to offer the channel [Trekspertise](https://youtu.be/Hziy8HcZAFE)

5: There are some fantastic suggestions already here, so I'd like to just add a few more that I like:

[Folding Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ) which is part vlog, part video essay, but the guy knows his stuff about films.

[Pop Culture Detective](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiwtz2tCEfS17N9A-WoSSw) produced some great work on masculinity, feminism depicted in pop movies and tv.

3: Lessons from the Screenplay - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw

One of the best, and most unique, in that the creator of the channel is hyper-focused on what the screenplay of a film tells you.

Folding Ideas - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ

Dan Olsen is one of the youtube greats, imo.

Contrapoints - https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints

Some folks might take issue with me saying ContraPoints is a video essayist, as she doesn't really analyze texts so much as movements, especially political movements. That being said, her style of video is much more visual and symbolic than a mere blog, and I think she qualifies because she uses textual evidence in her analysis.

## Film analysis



## Video game analysis

26: Ok, here we go!

I credit all of my continuing game design education and advancement to working on games, discussing game design with other intelligent game designers I know, and watching a bunch of different YouTube channels! Even a channel that isn't specifically about game design can be helpful just by being one of a few thoughtful voices talking about a topic that is design adjacent. Before we get to the lists, let me hit you with a few disclaimers.

- This is obviously not every channel out there. Don't just use my list and move on with your day. I peruse almost every "what is your favorite design / analysis channel" thread (like this one) and add more channels for me to review.
- I have not included channels that have not uploaded in several months, or their last several months of uploads were not game focused. There are several channels I am actually subscribed to that haven't posted in over a year because if they ever post again I would be happy to watch whatever they produce. If they are gone forever, being subscribed to them doesn't cost me anything.
- I have reviewed WAY more channels than this over the years and have rejected many. Some because they are hot garbage trash fires. Some because they don't do a good job of staying on topic or successfully arguing their points with evidence or other issues that I feel attack the core of analysis. Some because they just don't happen to be in a style I like. Finally, some because we disagree on game design and my flawed human nature caused me to categorize them in the first two rejection categories when the problem is actually me. If you know I have reviewed your channel in the past and don't see it here now, just assume it is because of the last two categories. It's me, not you.
- I have tried to keep smart, well thought out channels that I actively disagree with in the list and you should too. With lists this big it would be SUPER EASY to only subscribe to people you agree with and then almost guarantee you never grow out of your current bubble of thinking. Obviously I am human and I assume I unfairly hold channels I disagree with to a higher standard then ones that have a two hour video parroting my own opinions. Keep that in mind.
- Finally, sometimes I catch a channel with 1000, or 500 or even 50 subscribers who is just starting out and happens to not be very good. I can think of several examples on this list I rejected initially for reasons I still find valid, but the videos they produce today are great. If you reject a channel, it is a good idea to do a quick check-in a while later if one of their videos happens across your radar to see if they have improved.

------

**This is my current filtered list - roughly categorized and listed alphabetically.**

------

**Main Channels:** These are the channels that primarily focus on game analysis. Picked by me with some arbitrary cutoff before it becomes a "games history" channel or a "game review" channel or things like that.

------

**Analysis Adjacent:** These channels are outside of what I would traditionally consider game analysis proper. Often more review or retrospective or even a little let's play-ish. I like em and I still get enough value from them that I still subscribe, even if it is more for fun and enjoyment than education.

**To Be Reviewed:** These are in my "To Be Reviewed" bookmarks. A video from this channel probably caught my eye because I liked the topic or sometimes just the game, and I saved it to be reviewed later. These could totally suck or they could be super awesome, but it didn't seem fair to leave them off the list just because I have been too lazy to take the time to look them over.

> 3: **Joseph Anderson** is my favorite of the ones I recognize here. His videos aren't for everyone interested in this topic. They can be extremely long, but they're thorough, not redundant. I love this sort of content because more typical reviews give the impression there's much less to talk about these games than there actually is, so I like that attention can be drawn to elements of a game that are often glossed over.
>
> I want to say that **Super Bunnyhop** has begun to shift focus to videos about the gaming industry and away from the games themselves, which is still an area I can watch and appreciate.
>
> 0: Excellent list here, but I gotta question Raycevick. Is that one that falls under your fourth bullet point or do you actually enjoy the channel? My opinion is that it falls under, as you say, "hot garbage trash fires" but I'm open to hearing other opinions about the channel.
>
> > 4: What's wrong with *Raycevick*? Like, he has excellent production quality, great narration, and some very solid videos Some of his side series (i.e. not Years Later) can be a bit hit or miss, but I think they're all of generally high quality.
> >
> > > 1: Rayc has fantastic production quality, this extends to both the audio and the visual department, but I'm not too keen on his essays. To me, they hover too closely to the surface level and never really dive into anything interesting. He rarely gets into the nitty gritty about a game, mechanic, story, or system and explains what makes it great or bad or interesting or anything. It doesn't feel like analysis to me.
> > >
> > > > 1: That's not really explaining much to me. Besides, I do think he does go into a great bit of detail. Take his latest video on King Kong. He managed to convey how this movie title succeeded where others have failed and elaborate on its strength (atmosphere and immersive) and its weaknesses (lack of weapon variety).

3: Blobdole has a great list so I'll only add the ones that aren't on there. I'll note that not all of these make content currently and some don't exclusively do analysis but all of these channels are worth checking out.

Currently Active:

[Game Score Fanfare](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8P_raHQ4EoWTSH2GMESMQA) - Maybe the only channel dedicated to the analysis of music in video games

[Gamedenker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMXXBuIQvUD45EtfWqzU0FQ) - A Must Watch Channel, they took a hiatus but have teased that they'll be back soon

12: **EDIT**: I have added all this to the link here : https://github.com/SubSage/Youtube-reference-list Please feel free to contribute!

I have a txt file I try to update occasionally with a list of these kinds of channels. I'll paste it below! If you know of any channels to add, please do tell and I'll gladly update the list. I would love to eventually just put this up somewhere too, oh well, one day.

Hi reader! This is Sage's (subsage.github.io) Curated list of youtube channels that I like to show to people interested in learning more about game development/design. You might end up not liking every single channel on here, but you should perhaps make a good effort to try and view each channel. Each channel here has a unique view/perspective on vide games from development to design that can be very helpful to all trying to make their own game. I'll try to update this list time to time as well as order it in some fashion, right now it's rather unordered. If you'd like to add to the list, please just contact me and let me know of a channel that you think could do well to this list. Please enjoy!

Folding Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ Mostly focuses on design aspects of film, but I find that a good amount of what he speaks has some use in game design. He does play video games as well and can time to time help directly with game design.

TotalBiscuit : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1Ms_5qBTawC-k7PVjHXKQ Big name in gamedev for reviewing games.

**Mark Brown** : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw Documentary/analysis series on game design and development. Has amazing presentation skills and a good voice.

*Ahoy* : https://www.youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy Documentary style overview of history of games and mechanics within games.

*Raycevick* : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw Video essays on games.

Jim Sterling : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA A voice in game dev, somewhat more difficult to hear out time to time. Has opinions sometimes worth hearing on news within the field. I'd give him a pass if you're hard pressed for time.

Noah Caldwell-Gervais : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CYeHPLer3lbEhgonvbbAA Long form analysis (video essays) on games. Very, and I mean extremely comprehensive analysis/discussion on video games. A short video here is easily 45min+.

Stop skeletons from fighting : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Xeb9-FhZXgvw340n7PsCQ Can't really think of much for this channel, haven't seen a whole lot, but seems somewhat promising. Good source for seeing other games in the field.

**Errant Signal :** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4JnxTxtvItQecKUc4zRhQ Well worded video essays on games

Game soup : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPMrF9AN_D9BrmSmMeV3hA Analysis of video games

**Super Bunnyhop :** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw Well worded criticisms and reviews of games in general.

snowman Gaming : https://www.youtube.com/user/snomangaming Video essays on game design

Extra Credits : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg This channel I do not recommend for anyone already invested, experienced, or familiar with game developemnt. This channel is more catering to an audience who has no backing in game development, in the more recent work, material has been authoriative to the point that several people from gamedev communities (yours truly & Gamedev reddit comments) have questioned EC's credibility as a voice.

Game References : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTxB1BeJYiNmuI1Nl2Tomgw This channel show cases menus from various games. It's rather uknown. Great channel for referencing other games' UI decisions. It's only showcase, no explanations will be found here.

*GDC* : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ Game development conference. This is THE conference for game developers to meet/showcase/showoff their works and projects. This channel will post a fraction of their conference videos on their youtube channel. You will find a plethora of post mortems, discussions, big name QA, workshops, etc. You can sign up on GDC's site to get access too all of their material. Watch this if you're at all serious about learning more of the scene of gamedev.

Handmade hero : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTznQhurW5AaiYPbhEA-KA A well known veteran of game development is creating a game from scratch and showing you every single line of code as well as explaining everything as he goes. He's making everything from scratch. All the code from the low level interaction to making the CPU interact with the GPU to the high level concepts/implementations of game mechanics.

Career Coach : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DWn7tAAtT0SVQRqlJRknQ Very friendly and motivation coach for people interested in game development. Has good advice all around.

Rock Lee Smile : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgy-XzXwcdJKNKIUyzQmw7Q Reviews games, has reviewed a large array of indie games. Good source for seeing other games in the field.

Writing on Games : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlWv88ZRMxCcK3BGjrX7ew A channel that does in depth analysis of video games for mechanics he finds interesting. Provides good insight on several topics.

> 5: Jim Sterling is a terrible choice for this list.
>
> Most of the time, he reviews games without even paying attention to controls or game options, then spends whole video complaining about all that in-game, blaming developers. Same thing goes for basic gameplay elements.
>
> Basically, he doesn't pay attention to what's even going on in the game while reviewing them. Compare that to TB who actually spends (too much) time just talking about controls and video options at the start of his videos in every game.
>
> 2: I very much recommend [**Super Bunnyhop**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw) aka George who is a really smart dude and his videos are very well researched and entertaining. (Yes I have a bit of a man-crush on him)

2: Film critique has had more time and respect to develop its theory, and I feel that video game studies are struggling to catch up. Nevertheless, I do think Noah Caldwell-Gervais and **Errant Signal** are sufficient, though we should always strive for more.

3: I've been only to find a few so far:

[**Game makers toolkit** is exactly what you're looking for](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337)

[Also there's **Errant signal**, which is very similar](https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster)

[And my favorite is **Noclip**. Which isn't what youre describing, but it has very interesting documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw)

Doesn't talk about game design at all, is just an obsessed voice for the white male babies who are increasingly threatened by diversity and greater representation in gaming(and society in general, most likely).

There's a million people who base their whole Youtube persona or content style on outrage and it's just so damn boring and uninteresting to me.

> He's one of the few game reviewers who very thoroughly play games in their entirety before reviewing. He doesn't chase the newest trendiest game to push out a half-baked review and then move on to the next. He simply plays a game to completion, often an entire series of games to completion, and therefore gives you a very detailed and encompassing review of them.

50: [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) for industry veterans talking about game design and related issues.

[**Errant Signal**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4JnxTxtvItQecKUc4zRhQ) for in depth analysis of themes and the like.

[**Super Bunnyhop**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw) for in-depth, knowledgable user reviews.

> 19: I love **Superbunnyhop** and **Errant Signal**, but for people who don't know of them Extra Credits is really hit or miss for me. As far as I know, their resident expert James works heavily in mobile gaming so a lot of their perspective from inside the industry comes from that direction.
>
> Moreover, sometimes they make videos outside of their element that are really poorly researched and end up being misleading or just incorrect.

49: Also, GDC (the game developers conference) has a bunch of lectures free on YouTube on all kinds of topics. It’s not the sultry tones of Mark Brown, but I’m addicted to them.

> 20: IMO these are the real meat. Very informative and straight from the source.
>
> 4: I'm not even a music guy, but [Mick Gordon's talk on Doom's music](https://youtu.be/U4FNBMZsqrY) was very good

36: Nakey Jakey is my personal favorite, He blends in-depth analysis with comedy and he reflects on how video games affected his life ranging from really good times to really dark times and he's super creative and talented when it comes to his music and videos.

He also makes videos on topics that I don't really see anyone else making videos on such as save points in video games, video game box art, clothing in videos games, beer in video games, the art of video game commercials, the beauty of watching games and much much more.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSdma21fnJzgmPodhC9SJ3g

> 11: +1 Nakey Jakey. Everyone I've shown him too has gotten hooked. He has a great authorial voice; genuinely funny and occasionally heartbreakingly earnest.

26: *Core-A Gaming* is a fantastic resource for Fighing Game Philosophy / the FGC. While very specific, it's a near one-of-a-kind channel; very few people cover the FGC and fighting games in this regard, and most not nearly as well.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg

27: Super **bunnyhop**: video essays with a game journalism vibe on niche or specific topics

Gdc (game developer conforence) : presentations

Dark pixel : good, in depth reviews of jrpgs - makes discussion videos to participate in, also a podcast

Just a few off the top of my head

18: I really came around on the music in BotW after watching 8-Bit Music Theory's series on it. He digs into how the sparse and minimalistic music serves the game as a whole and its fascinating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl-6K3zrcr0

He covers a lot of what makes video game music so great, and is one of my favorite channel

16: EXTRA CREDITS. Compared to GMT, production quality is lower, but the specificity of topics in “ExtraCredits” is fantastic. And a lot of the time they talk about how game design principles can be applied elsewhere.

To get started, maybe check out the series on Incentive Systems in Politics, or the one on Balancing MMO Populations based on Bartle’s Taxonomy (you should find them by googling, but I’m on mobile and I’ll link later). Or just scroll through their gigantic list of topics and click the first one that gets your interest.

There’s at least 150 episodes and if you want more, check out ExtraFrames, which specifically discusses animation in games. They also do ExtraHistory and ExtraSciFi too.

> 22: I *REALLY* fell off with extra credits. "Myth of the Gun" is one of their best episodes. Nowadays though it feels like they're coasting on their laurels.

16: I really enjoy watching videos that discuss video games, so I put this list together ranking my favorite channels. I gave scores given to these youtube channels based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: The critic’s usage of varied diction, syntax, sentence structure, pacing when speaking, thought organization, how smoothly a video flows from point to point, and mastery over tone, volume, and speed. Channels were also scored based on their insight into the subject matter they discussed in videos. Essentially, if a critic only produced a cursory examination of a subject, they received a lower score. Conversely, if a critic produced new and thought provoking ideas about the subject they were discussing, they received a higher score.

**FAQ**

- Why didn't *youtube channel here* make the list?

If the channel was primarily focused on gaming news, comedy with video games, a single video game/game franchise, education/tutorial videos, or let's play videos, it did not make the list. This list is primarily for youtube channels focused on video game critique, reviews, and discussion.

- Why didn't *youtube channel here* make the list even though it fits the criteria?

I probably haven't heard of the channel. Youtube is a vast ocean of videos, and small channels are notoriously hard to find. Send me a message if you think you have a youtube channel that should be included on the list.

If you are unhappy in any way about this list, please know that I just made it for fun. This is all my subjective opinion and is in no way a universal standard. If you find a channel you love through this post, even if it was rated poorly, then I couldn't be happier. I just want to share channels I like with others.

  > I second Joseph Anderson, he puts out long, scripted, heavily edited videos. They usually contain spoilers (he walks through the entire story and analyses it), but always opens with a short (5-15 minutes) spoiler free recommendation.

  > I really like [The Gaming Brit](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGamingBritShow). He uploads very rarely, but I love his videos. He don't post only reviews or analysis, but sometimes how a game sucks and why, giving a lot of arguments. His master piece is [the 30 minutes video about Other M](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX4mhp-8sOc) (and another [15 minutes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfS0254dRRw) with rebuttal of some comments).

> 3: You should definitely check out [*Raycevick*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw/featured?disable_polymer=1). He's most known for his "X Years Later" series. I would put his in the 9/10 or maybe even 10/10 category.

8: I like **Mark Brown**'s videos but every time I see him stream he completely sucks at any game he plays and misses important parts of the game, so he is a confusing person to me.

7: I would add these to the list, even if they are rather newbies to this topic

[Adam Millard - The Architect of Games](https://www.youtube.com/user/Thefearalcarrot/videos)

[Leonardo Da Sidci](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCujjLOPLW92zVBlhaL8wxPg/videos)

Edit: I'd add another one, tho its more like a documentary with the developers about their games

[**Noclip**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw/videos)

### Best video game reviewers on Youtube

> Reviewers on youtube similar to Jim, Totalbiscut, Yahtzee, And Angry Joe?

37: Idiotech and **Super Bunnyhop** are pretty good.

> 7: Super Bunnyhop had more of an in-depth and analysis-like style, moist similar to TB (but mute analytical) from OP's list.

23: Dont quite know if it fits your bill, but from a shere point of quality i'd recommend [**MatthewMatosis**](https://www.youtube.com/user/Matthewmatosis), or [Joseph **Anderson**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ), both does extremely in-depth reviews or analysis

> 17: I second Joseph Anderson, he puts out long, scripted, heavily edited videos. They usually contain spoilers (he walks through the entire story and analyses it), but always opens with a short (5-15 minutes) spoiler free recommendation. Don't expect to see a lot of games from him, he takes his time (5 months between his last (God of War) video and the one before it).

17: Karak from **ACG**, does nice in-depth reviews.

> 19: That aren't 2 minutes long or filled with sponsored bull crap.
>
> > My comment: is this a joke about IGN? :)

9: **Super Bunnyhop** is probably my favourite one (besides TB of course)

7: I discovered YongYea about a month ago. So far he's been great for news and general punditry.

5: SidAlpha's quite a good pundit if you like the industry commentatry.

> 11: Sid's gone a little sideways lately. I haven't seen a review pop up from him in ages and he's just turned into a drama channel that's started to show off that he's nothing like TB

7: WorthABuy has a very cynical elitist PC gamer attitude you might like

5: youtube channel "Worth A Buy" is pretty good

4: Karak from **ACG** is great, as is SkillUp. **SuperBunnyhop** has already been mentioned, so I'll throw in Idiotech and Luetin09. And of course, we couldn't skip SidAlpha.

Hope this helps!

4: Gotta shout out my boy SkillUp! He does long-form reviews that are quite awesome and not something I typically see in game reviews.

5: Mack @ https://www.youtube.com/user/Worthabuyguys

> 6: I really like his reviews but I really hate his edgy social commentary.

2: Not gaming, but Gigguk does anime videos and was inspired by Yahtzee which can be easily seen in his work

2: Not quite like what you've mentioned but *Easy Allies* is an excellent place for reviews and discussions about games.

They're the former Gametrailers crew.

2: Reiterating, **ACG** is pretty great. Has an incredibly fun way with words, though he doesn't do skits or anything like Angry Joe.

Boomstick (the guy who had his Dead Cells review plagiarized) seems pretty decent. His delivery is... a bit dull but the critique is interesting enough. Videos may be brief for some people's tastes, but he manages to cover a lot of ground despite that. *Raycevick* is more analytical and recent retrospective, but could be up your alley. Gggmanlives seems pretty okay from what I've watched so far. SplatterCatGaming (I think I got turned to him, *Raycevick*, and Gggman on this sub so basically just echoing others on these recommendations) does first impressions of indy and mid-shelf games. Less reviews, more of a let's play format with jokey commentary. Even if you aren't into his format (and I don't blame you), I'd suggest subbing regardless if you dig obscure indie games like the ones TB covered regularly since SCG does that sort of thing almost exclusively.

Lazy Game Reviewer might strike your fancy, he does that part critique/part comedy thing that Joe does--albeit with mostly retro games, old/strange hardware, and recent sim games/their expansions. Also, the skits have been pretty cut down more recently. Aside from reviews, his Tech Tales series is basically a bunch of mini-documentaries and they are fascinating (the only gaming doc YouTubers I think do better jobs are Noclip and, of course, *Ahoy*). He doesn't do them *too* often, but they have nice production values which make it worth the wait (imo, at least) and there's a sizeable backlog to dive into for newcomers.

>  Who is your most trusted source of game reviews?

54: *Easy Allies*

> 4: It’s because of them I bought Yakuza 0 having never heard of the series before - one of the best purchases of 2017 for me.
>
> 2: Agreed. Their Frametrap podcast is also great, it's just a ridiculously long discussion about the games they are playing and what they think about them. They'll cover a lot of games that might not get a regular review.

35: **ACG** - youtube - very neutral, always explaines why he likes or dislikes specific things and even if you dont agree with him, he makes sure you know how he got to his conclusion.

skillup - youtube - i dont agree with everything, however i am always sure he played the games he reviews ( you can watch him play the games on twitch somethimes). and like **ACG** he explaines how he comes to his conclusion.

both of these are also familyfriendly in language, if that is of concern

*easy allies* - youtube - their reviews are shorter then the named above, so i would choose them for something really quick, where i just want to know what the game has to offer.

also i watch Jim Sterling. i almost never agree with his opinions (with some exeptions) , however i find him funny and he is usually very honest about his opinions. though definitly NOT family friendly language lol

16: Streams of actual, non-industry people playing the game I want to know about. Even if you don't have the time to watch all the stream, you can get a feel for the title and, if the chat is slow enough, ask questions about the specifics you care about to the person playing.

You can't really hide things in uninterrupted gameplay and random low-tier streamers don't have much to lose by dunking on a game.

Sure you can't get pre-release information about a game from a random stream (they usually only let press get that kind of access) but who the heck buys games near release anyway? Wait a while for the suckers who bought it to work out all the bugs and swoop in after some patch cycles for a better experience.

12: None. I usually read multiple reviews from a lot of different sources. Things they have in common are probably correct.

7: I follow The Angry Joe Show on YouTube (with Joe Vargas) because I feel like his taste in games aligns pretty closely with mine, other than his whole anti-zombie game thing. Plus I just think him and Other Joe are hilarious. And he also tends to review movies I'm interested in too, and covers gaming industry news.

His videos are longer than five minutes, but he tends to give a critical overview in the first few minutes, then elaborates on how he came to that conclusion in the rest of the video.

I also really like Zero Punctuation for quick but I wouldn't call Yahtzee a non-biased reviewer, he definitely has obvious preferences that color his opinions about games.

> 9: i agree but i wish he would just calm down a little.
>
> then again its kind of his schtick so i cant really complain too badly.

7: Gameranx, they dont give scores and just state the “facts” and talk aboutvthe game which i like

> Second this, "Before you Buy" is my go to for any games I'm on the fence about

5: I enjoy **ACG**. Not 5 minute long but much more in depth, structured reviews without any spoilers. Check him out on YouTube.

3: **ACG** is really comprehensive

5: I'm a fan of Gameranx. And *Easy Allies* is good too.

3: Destructoid is fairly accurate. I’ve followed them for years.

2: **ACG** if I can spare the time. Easy Allies otherwise.

---

44: I personally love Skill Up. Australian reviewer that mainly focuses on looter-shooters and single player campaigns, super thorough. He also has a "Don't Miss This" series where he highlights easily overlooked games. He talks a lot about how the game feels, it's less a focused category-by-category breakdown of the game. Highly recommend.

> 5: MMMMMM looter shooters, one of my fav genres. I will def be giving this a look. Im a total whore for anything loot driven. I will grind games like Diablo or Borderlands for 1,000s of hours.

32: The best one I can think of is Accursed Farms. One of the series on that channel is "Ross's game dungeon," where he mostly reviews old or forgotten games.

> 21: Just be warned that a lot of what Ross reviews on the Game Dungeon is well within the "I played this so you don't have to" category.
>
> 10: Came to say this. Excellent channel, someone recommended it to me a couple of months ago and I've already seen all game dungeon videos. I've heard his Freeman's mind videos are great too.

25: **Mandalore Gaming**, *Ragnarrox*, Ssethtzeentach, Noah Caldwell Gervais, **Mark Brown**, and the website Rock Paper Shotgun.

> 20: Ssethtzeentach
>
> Whether you agree with his humour or not, Sseth has recommended/reviewed a lot of really good games, old or new(ish), and I found my current favourite, Starsector, through him.
>
> > 9: Hard agree. His humor can be extremely edgy and abrasive, but he regularily recommends games that I end up loving. Instead of giving a general overview or summarising the different aspects (story, gameplay, graphics etc.), he focuses on the strange details and peculiarities that make those games unique and worth playing. He really highlights the games' strenghts and has a different approach for each one. I really like this style and he convinced me to check out quite a few games so far.
> >
> > 12: I'd call him the 4Chan version of **Mandalore**.
>
> 17: Noah Caldwell Gervais
>
> seconded.

23: **Errant Signal** is one of my favorite channels. While they will occasionally look at mainstream games, most are weird indie games and theres one episode of them just trying out random steam games.

> 4: **Errant signal** is my favorite. He's great at picking apart game systems and not just showing how they work, but what they say about the games subject. He's really the first person who got me to think seriously about games as an artistic medium in concrete terms.

15: I have some great ones you'll want to check out:

- [**LGR**](https://www.youtube.com/user/phreakindee) - A legend in the retro gaming community. Has a broader focus than the others, and does videos ranging from games, hardware, books, and other things.
- [*Gaming Historian*](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcfrosticles) - Another legend. Does lots of in-depth videos on gaming hardware and games.
- [*Ahoy*](https://www.youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy) - Pretty much the same as the above. Fantastic channel.
- [Jeremy Parish](https://www.youtube.com/user/toastyfrog) - Very underrated. Does in-depth, game-by-game explorations videos of the Gameboy, NES, and SNES catelogs.
- [*My life in Gaming*](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeingaming) - A great up and coming retro gaming channel. Does videos on hardware, getting the best picture from retro games, retrospectives, and more.
- [Daniel Ibbertson](https://www.youtube.com/user/djslopesroom) - Another great retro channel channel. Very 90s focused.
- [Kim Justice](https://www.youtube.com/user/elmyrdehory) - Pretty decent, has some good videos.
- [Jimmy Hapa - Import Gaming FTW](https://www.youtube.com/user/jimmyhapa) - Focused on games from the 90s that never left Japan.

15: Suspecting from relooking at rules this MAY be off topic since its asking for reccomendations...but not on games. Again my apologies if this is indeed off topic. I know though I will get MUCH better and more serious answers here then any general gaming reddit/forum though. People here understand and see games in a different way

> 5: **ACG** Reviews. Very thorough game reviews.
>
> 8: **Mandalore**
>
> Sseth is also similar, less in-depth but with more humor.
>
> He reviews games so niche his videos already DDOS'd servers of two games.

9: Mm. These may be *too* deep of cuts but you might check out Stop Skeletons from Fighting. They like to look at 1) Spooky games and 2) Old games that were perhaps overly ambitions for their time.

You may not find a whole ton of stuff you're going to run out and grab but knowing there was a playable prototype of Resident Evil 1 on the Gameboy Color was certainly entertaining in and of itself.

I *was* totally introduced to the D series, Illbleed, Wild Guns, and the Doom playstation edition (with new music and spooky lighting!) through them for what it was worth and I did wind up getting my hands on those so there may be something there for ya though a lot of it is gonna be older.

9: He can be a bit dry and has a very particular taste, but **Matthewmatosis** might be what you're looking for. He has a background in software development, and in my opinion has more interesting insights than the likes of **Game Maker's Toolkit** or *GamingBrit*. While his most popular videos have to do with well-known games like Dark Souls, he has a lot of videos on more obscure stuff like Rain World, Spacechem and the Wonderful 101.

7: **LGR**

6: A few of my go-to video game channels (All reviews/retrospectives)

[**Mandalore Gaming**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOGLGPOqlAiLmOvXW5lKbw) - pretty well known now, has a tendency to play odd Russian Games but goes in depth about everything he plays. In many ways his videos are an adequate replacement for actually playing some of these older or just clunkier titles.

[B-Mask](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbBxFs86hk6IMd16YlfXPg) - Wonderful YouTuber with *the* defining videos on the Sly Cooper games which is a must watch for any fans of that series. Brilliantly in depth with a focus on stories and visual storytelling from a theatre background.

[Pepp's Indie Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkCPjKpngDHZp0orr7GuGA) - The actual videos aren't the best due to the frequency this guy puts out videos, but the actual review in the narration is still fine - worth following just to see a new game every otther day and just watch the ones when you're interested

[Alpha Beta Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKNiazqmuUi9CeX_kyDpjw) - the YT channel of a website which plays and documents early stage indie video games. Brings out a 20-30min no-commentary gameplay video sometimes multiple times a day - again, worth following and clicking on the ocassional video if it looks good.

[Table 53](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimJO6nZt-Yanp2j8Kd9g0Q?view_as=subscriber) - (actually me) focus on quality, niche indie games. If a game isn't good or worth playing I tend not to write about it. Occasionally produces longer, detailed retrospective style content on bigger games (Sunset Overdrive, Ico in the next week or so)

------

[LesserMan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2a_P0QAZkdqGvOPDbpwfQ) - Plays a lot of 'old school' PS2 classics with a long form 'review' style that covers the entire game's story with frequent (sometimes too frequent) jokes and animations. If it's your thing you will absolutely love it so definitely worth watching a few minutes just in case.

[Shut Up & Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRhIGDUKdIOw07Pd8pHxCw) - The best channel on YouTube produces wonderful <u>videos about board games</u> with incredible production quality both in a writing and technical sense, they support a full five man company purely from donations, and also host a site with frequent well written reviews about board gaming, and an excellent monthly podcast. So if you love board gaming you have to give them a watch.

[Eurothug4000](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxddeIv7GdHNcVPZI9JvGXQ) - The channel is nothing like the name. A woman who is far too obsessed with the upcmoing Death Stranding, but has made some incredibly insightful videos looking into the trailers and coming up with theories about possible gameplay and lore. Also writes detailed reviews of games including Dino Crisis and Animal Crossing: Wild World

[Quest Marker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH6gsbnwEM76Jn-HrBI6Syg) - A very small channel with some wonderful, calm videos about small indie games. Posts a video about every month so no spam in the subscription feed and talks about games worth hearing about.

---

17: **ACG** is my main reviewer I go to

> 13: **ACG** is consistent, but mostly shallow. Kinda the thing you'll get if you skim the pros/cons at the end of an article, but 15 mins long
>
> > 4: And not full of sponsored bull crap
>
> 2: He doesn't really take advantage of the medium in my opinion. He's too safe in his assessments as to avoid angering or offending anyone. Just comes across as a fake radio host to me.

11: I always enjoy *Easyallies* reviews of games. Generally impartial and go to a reasonable depth. I haven't had any bad recommendations from them yet.

> 5: Just an FYI, the *EasyAllies* crew are all former [Gametrailers.com](https://gametrailers.com/) producers and writers. So if you liked [Gametrailers.com](https://gametrailers.com/) and their videos, definitely give their channel a go.

7: I’m a big fan of Worth a Buy. Beware though, he will tear your game a new one if it’s shit.

6: *Racavick* or however u spell it and skillup

Edit: *Raycevick*

> 2: I like skillup but as much as he says hes not a fanboi, he totally is a fanboi.
>
> Also Upvote for *Racavick*! Guy is great. :) (Also love his Celldweller plug every chance he gets!) :)
>
> > 2: Skill up kinda annoying butttt he really put out for warframe my fave game of all time (close to 3k hours) so i like tolerate him lol
> >
> > > 1: Yes. It was funny how he was “done with destiny” and yet clenched to that like no tomorrow.
> > >
> > > I applaud warframe and DE, im a casual so i dabble in it from time to time, mates are heavy into it.. like 5th or 6th play through on a stock account. So i get why people tolerate him. I like him cause he’s aussie, and its fun to give him shit (aussies are great shit talkers)

5: [GrimBeard](https://www.youtube.com/user/GrimbeardDiaries/videos) goes into great depth. His humour is also very self-aware and sometimes quite dark. 5k subs and is criminally under rated.

[2kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/user/2kliksphilip/videos), well spoken and does alot of nostalgic reviews. 383k subs, (he has several channels).

[**SuperBunnyHop**](https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow/videos) is another YouTuber that goes into great depth. He has a series called *Games in my Inbox*. 373k subs.

[**MandaloreGaming**](https://www.youtube.com/user/MandaloreGaming/videos). Even though he doesn't upload videos often, [he made a video segment showcasing smaller YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT2mEO0JtOo), some of which are on my list. 153k subs.

[Voxis Productions] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm16YNvy3AaEG7T8bcPGtQ). The host of the review is a classy and hilarious puppet, which is a unique feature that you don't see on YouTube very often. 31k subs.

> 2: +1 for grimbeard, underrated.

3: I like Caddicarus a lot. He's thorough in his explanations and very entertaining. He does talk about spoilers somewhat often but he always tells you it's coming so you can skip ahead or not watch the video.

3: I have a couple. Most reviewers, especially smaller ones tend to specialize in a certain style of game or era.

Channels that review indie and retro inspired new games. Kimchika (maybe the best person I’ll mention as they stream new games a ton while discussing them). Critique Quest (maybe the best review channel on YouTube)

Retro based but review new retro inspired games. St1ka (a small channel that’s picking up pace quick, he’s a review channel only with a weekly stream.)

I have a couple more, but they are mostly retro only but include new games for retro systems so I’ll leave them off the list.

3: I like to watch a mix of people like videogamedunkey, Caddicarus and Yahtzee from zero punctuation.

Though I find that my main source and who I trust the most is Gameranx. I just like their attitude I guess. They structure their reviews in a very talkative way, as if they're discussing it with the viewer personally. I like how they seem to emphasize how a game "feels" as well. Definitely worth a look into.

---

2: If you want a group, definitely *Easy Allies* (staffed my former GameTrailers veterans, including the original co-owner/video narrator). For single person, my favourite is SomeCallMeJohnny. He’s a chill dude who loves games, especially Sonic and Metroid.

> 2: My man!!!!!!!!!! He’s also extremely funny on his Twitch and LP channel.

2: **Acg**

2: Dunkey, hands down

> Who are some YouTubers that make content on gaming that I could binge watch?

43: **Check out** https://www.youtube.com/user/Matthewmatosis

Or **Joseph Anderson** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ

I can also recommend https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkoek2012

> is this abandoned?

How about some **speedrunning**? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtUbO6rBht0daVIOGML3c8w

Or some documentaries by *Ahoy*? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE1jXbVAGJQEORz9nZqb5bQ

> 15: *Ahoy* makes some HQ content. The wait between new video always get me

> 21: +1 for *Ahoy*.
>
> Also, I like [*Game Sack*](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrGameSack). They're low budget and corny jokes, but the last few years of their stuff is pretty good.
>
> > 4: I feel like *Game Sack* is just ok. In some way, I do enjoy their coverage of some unknown titles, but pretty often <u>they give us wrong information</u>. I find myself disagreeing a lot with some of their short reviews as well.
> >
> > I also can't help but feel they have a certain disdain to PC gaming.
> >
> > *Ahoy* is awesome though. Top notch quality content.
> >
> > > 1: Yeah, they focus pretty much on console gaming. And from the perspective of someone who can't do internet research (especially in the early days of the channel). But I do like their focus on out there games and systems that don't get much love (like the Atari Lynx, Turbo Grafx 16, etc...).
> > >
> > > > 2: It's not really their focus on console gaming that bothers me (at least not much), but that, many times, they don't even aknowledge that some of the games that they have covered also have a PC version.
> > > >
> > > > Like "X title available on Xbox 360 and PS3", but fail to mention that the game is also on PC version. And when they do mention, their tone when they say "PC"... It just gives me the impression that they really dislike PC gaming for whatever reason (well, when they covered Doom, they played it on a MAC, and using a source port that I never even heard of before).
> > >
> > > 1: I also can't help but feel they have a certain <u>disdain to PC gaming</u>.
> > >
> > > Agreed, and <u>they also shit on emulation</u>. They called it a dirty word lol.
> > >
> > > I do have some hope for *Game Sack* since Dave is leaving but we'll see.
>
> 4: +1 for **Joseph Anderson**! I've been on and off with his Patreon, love his channel.

28: If you're intro retro technology or other stuff like that, there's a couple along with Digital Foundry.

**LGR** is great, lots of old computer, games, and generally old stuff.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ

*My Life in Gaming* have really fascinating in depth looks on retro consoles as well as interesting series on the best way to play those consoles today.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpvtp7mH0Cdq8FQUxcjDq0Q

**Superbunnyhop** does a lot of in depth looks at things around gaming or games. Some really great pieces.

https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow/videos

Clemps has a style of humor that's not for everyone, but I find it entertaining. Reviews of mostly JRPGs.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQfl8QxjNen736AVO3ecFg

**Mandalorgaming** does a lot of reviews of older titles as well.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOGLGPOqlAiLmOvXW5lKbw

Also not for everyone, his comedy style might be extremely off putting to some, is SsethTzeentach. They're comedic reviews of older games.

https://www.youtube.com/user/SsethTzeentach/videos

24: funhaus

18: Anyone affiliated with Northernlion.

Raise your dongers.

> 4: Oh man, I checked out his channel, and this guy uploads a lot! Several videos a day! I feel like this might be a bit too much for me, seeing as he has 1200 videos on Binding of Isaac and 500 on Slay the Spire alone! I'll give a couple a watch and see if it's for me. Thanks for the suggestion.

12: **MandalorGaming** for some off-the-beaten-track reviews in a really clever, in depth manner. Stuff you'd likely not have played, or maybe even heard of before, but will appreciate knowing about.

His Eye Divinity Cybermancy review of as fantastic, and his weapon descriptions sold me in a moment: "The smg has two fire modes, full auto <shooting> and fuller auto <REALLY INTENSE SHOOTING>"

11: GVMERS is a channel of quality.

10: neebs_gaming

They're amazing. Unique channel. They do "series", as in TV like series, but using video games, with characters and storylines.

11: I like NakeyJakey. It's different but he has some great takes on classic video games+modern. He's pretty funny as well.

> 4: Love Jakey! His music is awesome too!

9: CallMeKevin makes hilarious let's play style videos -- I love binge-watching them! His Sims playthrough cracks me up and he seems like a genuinely nice person.

> 6: I've heard of him before, I think he did a couple videos on Heavy Rain that made me laugh very hard! I could be mistaken though. I'll give him a sub and check out a few videos!

8: [Quill18](https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18) is one of my favourites. Generally plays slower paced games, 4X and grand strategy, with a bit of citybuilding and Dwarf Fortress thrown into the mix.

10: jerma985

nowadays on 2ndjerma

7: videogamedunkey is funny af

6: *Raycevick* for AAA analysis, **MandaloreGaming** for relatively old janky but interesting games worth looking at for various reasons, and Game Maker's Toolkit for lots of game mechanic and world analysis.

6: *Raycevick*, **Super Bunny Hop**, **ACG**, Digital Foundry, Skill-Up, Laymen Gaming, Videogamedunkey, ItsAGundam, **Joseph Anderson,** Writing on Games, ReviewtechUSA, *Ahoy*, theScore esports, and Core-A-Gaming.

These are my favorites.

I avoid YongYea, AngryJoe, Jim Sterling, Cleanprice Gaming, LegacyKillaHD, The Quartering, Boogie2988 and Downward Thrust.

Totalbiscuit was the best but he's gone now (RIP).

> 9: TB was truly the best, I've yet to find a youtuber that does what TB as well as he did
>
> 5: I love *Raycevick*, **Superbunnyhop**, **ACG**, Skill-Up, Laymen Gaming, Dunkey, **Joseph Anderson**, and theScore!
>
> I haven't heard of ItsAGundam, Writing on Games, ReviewtechUSA or Core-A-Gaming, and I actually just learned about *Ahoy* with his new video on Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks.
>
> Considering you like a lot of the creators I like, I will be sure to check out the others! Thanks!
>
> Also, may I ask why you avoid some of those channels? I personally am not a fan of Yong, Downward Thrust or The Quartering, but I don't know too much about the others (I know Cleanprince was in some drama, but I know very little about it)

7: [SsethTzeentach](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6VugMZKRhSyzWEWA9W2fg) for meme game reviews every now and then (not new releases, just random games.) great humor, his videos always make me laugh

[rwhitegoose](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC42NgAW2U0ZF_HTUw4mE_gQ) for very in-depth, mostly GoldenEye, speedrun analyses and speedrun related content. i'm not even into goldeneye but listening to someone talk about something they're extremely passionate about is something i can do for hours at a time, it will never get boring

[**Noclip**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw) for very well put together documentaries on different games/developer studios that provide you with insight on the circumstances the game was developed under, why was something one way or another, history of the studio, etc.

### Best Youtube channels about speedrunning

28: [**Summoning Salt**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtUbO6rBht0daVIOGML3c8w/videos)

14: [*EZscape*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIyZiiHXIH7KkqfaDvBmG-Q/featured)

5: [TASVideosChannel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TASVideosChannel) holds encodes of all runs accepted by [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/), even runs that have since been obsoleted; it's probably easier to navigate through the TASVideos site than to browse the channel directly.

21: Hopefully someone suggests something good, but honestly I don't think there's much else out there that fills the same niche. The closest thing I can think of is well-commentated *Games Done Quick* speedruns. If you look up Reddit threads on GDQs, you can usually find the good ones called out.

There's also [pannenkoek2012](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMm211NGh4Ls5SAMZJF7E8A), but that's not really speedrunning.

> 6: I think Summoningsalt is really unique in his way of narrating the developments in speedrunning. He's just great at giving an inside perspective. Really jealous of his smb1 time if I might add

6: So look for the paper mario the thousand year door one, then you have averagetrey who did super mario sunshine vids for any% and 100%. Lately ccneverender has done videos for 100% and any% pokemon snap as well as started a new channel called speed docs for several other games. There are a few scattered videos on mario bros and one on ocarina of time as well. That's all I've been able to find aside from some lower quality vids.

7: I wouldn't really say he will give you specific tricks, but he does explain some of the major ones used in certain games, along with the general history of speed running certain games. Name is **Summoning Salt**.

7: If you search "[speedrun post commentary](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=speedrun+post+commentary)" or "[gdq submission](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gdq+submission)" they're usually explaining what they're doing.

"[speedrun tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=speedrun+tutorial)" would work too and sometimes go more indepth, slowing down to show things multiple times and with different strats.

1: There's not one general channel, no. Depending on the game, their community might have created tutorials.

Otherwise, the *GDQ* youtube channel exists.

1: RPG limit break is similar to *GDQ*

---

3: Maybe you'd enjoy one of the speedrunning podcasts? Obviously you can't watch a run that way but you may still enjoy them.

2: Do you mean something like this video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBP-DScpE44 (commentary on a wr, meant for use as a guide)

2: Regular Unofficial Speedrun Highlights

1: Hey I know I’m late but you should definitely check out the GlobalSpeedrunAssociation YouTube channel. Lots of cool races and stuff being commentated!

### Best Youtube channels about retro gaming

18: **Game Sack** is my favorite. But I also like my own, Teaching Retro

> 8: Honest yet courteous. Have an upvote!
>
> I like AVGN and also Ancient DOS Games (ADG), who put a lot of effort in documenting the best DOSBox settings for all the games he's covered.
>
> > 5: I will always love watching AVGN and James and Mike Mondays.
>
> > 2: Thanks, I've watched everyone mentioned in this thread except ADG, I'll have to check it out later tonight.

10: SNESDrunk and **LGR**.

8: AVGN, *My Life in Gaming*, Game Chasers, Last Gamer.

8: Yep, + 1 to **Game Sack** being the best retro gaming YouTube channel out there.

Some others good ones include:

LazyGameReviews - Good Windows/MS DOS game reviews with very high production quality.

*My Life In Gaming* - I’ve only started watching this channel, and I’m digging it so far. Best channel by far if your looking at how to make your retro consoles look great on modern TVs.

*Gaming Historian* - Great documentaries for well known retro games and Nintendo products

Kim Justice - My favorite of the many talented UK retro gaming channels. Pretty much introduced me to the microcomputers of the 80s and incredibly informative documentaries about both well known and obscure games/companies.

Larry Bundy - Second favorite of the UK retro gaming channels, and my usual go to when I’m looking for a humorous slant on UK retro gaming.

Classic Gaming Quarterly - Good videos about console launches and I also enjoy the episodes where he reads through older gaming magazines.

Happy Console Gamer - Mostly focuses on newer games lately, but has many retro episodes as well (especially around Ys, Dragon Quest, Mega Man, and Phantasy Star). Side note that he’s also a goddamn vampire or something, as I refuse to believe he is over 40 years old.

ProJared - Also mostly focuses on newer stuff, but will occasionally crank out a video or two about older RPGs/Simulation games/ Games that haunted his childhood. Also uploads Let’s Plays frequently if your into that.

4: It's not completely retro gaming, but *The Gaming Historian* has quality content that's been pretty enjoyable to watch.

3: I like **LGR**, MetalJesusRocks, ProJared, *Gaming Historian*, Did you know gaming?, Daniel Ibbertson, Larry Bundy Jr. There's so many good ones.

> 2: Yes to all of these!

---

8: **LGR**

8: **GAME SACK**

> 3: Yeah same, love game sack it's where I discover all my games.

5: 

1. *My Life in Gaming*

2. RetroRGB

> 1: The only 2 u will ever need

> 5 years ago opinions

11: [*Game Sack*](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrGameSack) is one of my favourites (they also have a subreddit and [r/gamesack](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamesack/)).

I'm also subscribed to [Gaming History Source](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamingHistorySource) as they compare the releases of a game over a variety of platform, and it's always interesting to see how a particular game was redone over different platforms to work on that particular hardware.

9: [Classic Game Room](http://www.youtube.com/user/InecomCompany) was the first YouTube gaming channel that I got in to. I actually started watching back in 2008, which was his first year "back" doing gaming videos.

[*Game Sack*](http://www.youtube.com/user/MrGameSack) is probably the best gaming channel on YouTube. Or maybe just my favorite, as someone who doesn't watch Let's Plays, Top 10 Lists, and Finds videos.

[*The Gaming Historian*](http://www.youtube.com/user/mcfrosticles) is a channel that I actually just recently discovered but I've been very impressed with what I've seen so far.

[NesGuide.com](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCunqYBAGc0gn-HjLQgiUfhQ) is a great channel when you want to check out a NES game that you've never played before. They just show gameplay footage with no voiceover or anything. Because sometimes you hear about a game with which you are unfamiliar and you just want to see it.

[Classic Gaming Quarterly](http://www.youtube.com/user/cgquarterly) is my own channel, and since I make the kind of videos that I like to watch, I'd be remiss if I didn't list it among my favorites.

6: Gamechasers

electric adventures

the video game years

> 5: Video Game Years is so good. It amazes me that it doesn't get at least 100,000 views per episode.
>
> 1: Gamechasers is good. But sometimes feels scripted. I mean, everyone(USA), has access to interweb. Every flea market/ garage sale are going (retail) prices. And every video about a "cool game" is put out, prices skyrocket. I'm not complaining because I started collecting in 2006. But as far as collecting,not resale, goes, it does not matter. What I collect is not for sale. As far as question, *Gamesack*, AVGN would be first without mainstream...

7: No My Life in Gaming? They're one of the first channels I'd consider when compiling a list like this.

Otherwise, well done. That there's a fine list other than the aforementioned omission of MLiG.

5: Gaijillionaire is criminally under-viewed. His stuff is exceptionally well produced. I especially love his "commercial breaks" that use real 80s and 90s Japanese video game commercials.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6zYKiueCEA

Jeremy Parish's channel is phenomenal. Even though his Retronauts stuff is well known, his YouTube channel doesn't get a huge audience. But his videos are extremely well researched and can reach an almost academic level of comparative analysis if you watch them in chronological order.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHIcoBgbt6w

8-bit Guy and RetroManCave are great if you like old computers and restoration videos, along with your game content.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jr7Q1yJOUM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rvRRCa8Kik

Kelsey Lewin doesn't update often, but it's always a great in-depth piece on something unusual when she does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykRmzS-FYSQ

I recently started watching Friday Night Arcade, and am liking it a bunch so far, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHLDL83YuK0

> 2: Gajillionaire has really stepped it up over the last year or so. Definitely recommend his channel. Fantastic.
>
> Parish needs to get off his crutch of the same 5 Nintendo games. The lack of actual experience with games they're talking about has been a problem with Retronauts his Ray left...
>
> > 3: I haven't listened to Retronauts in years, but I do remember them kinda winging it sometimes. But Parish's YouTube channel is literally a new game every episode, so definitely doesn't lack in variety. He does a good job of going into some depth about why each game is (or isn't) interesting/novel/important to the evolution of game design.

3: **LGR** appears to be very good when it comes to a North American perspective primarily on personal/home computer games. I don't watch many of his videos myself, but the ones I have watched have been put together well.

---

12: Ones I like (in no specific order):

- *Game Sack*
- Retro Core
- *Gaming Historian*
- Console Wars
- Game vs. Game
- *My Life In Gaming*
- Jenovi
- Nostalgia Nerd
- Cinemassacre (home of AVGN)
- Larry Bundy Jr.
- Ben Heck Show
- Retro Revisited
- Wrestler With Gaming

Others I watch occasionally, but don't necessarily watch every episode:

- Metal Jesus Rocks
- RGT 85
- Pat The NES Punk
- SNES Drunk
- John Hancock (his channel might have another name, but he looks like Al from *Home Improvement*)

Probably some others I'm forgetting as well that will get mentioned in this thread.

> 3: Happy to see Jenovi mentioned. He has a great and criminally under subbed channel.

> 2: Ben heck hasn't done anything related to gaming in quite a while, retro gaming even longer. I really liked his retro games mods, but you need to dig through his channels earlier history for them. Portable versions of consoles, DVD changer Xbox 360, slot loading NES, Nintendo PlayStation prototype, he's done some great builds.
>
> *Game Sack*, *My Life In Gaming*, Metaljesusrocks, and **LGR** are my main goto channels for retro gaming content.

11: *My Life in Gaming* has a lot of game content aside from their RGB tutorials.

6: A few I'd recommend, as someone who also enjoys Ashens and *Game Sack*'s hardware reviews:

- [RetroManCave](https://www.youtube.com/user/RetroManCave) (a lot of hardware restoration and repairs)
- [**LGR**](https://www.youtube.com/user/phreakindee) (the "Oddware" videos in particular throw up some interestingly weird bits and pieces of hardware from the past)
- [Classic Game Room](https://www.youtube.com/user/InecomCompany) (chances are if you're after an enthusiastic review about something, this long-running channel will have one).

4: Look up Bithead1000 on youtube. My new favorite.

1: AVGN and Pat the NES Punk's Completely Unnecessary Podcast.

> 6: I like about 60% of the CUP. Some of it is good, but there's quite of bit of YouTube drama stuff that gets old really fast.

1: [The Game Chasers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78PzEVn5zWK4No0dPQHVQw) is without doubt one of my favourite channels on YouTube.

Funny as hell, 7 seasons deep and basically American Pickers with two dumb chodes from Texas looking to build their collections.

Also:

- **LGR**
- *TheGamingHistorian*
- AVGN/Cinemassacre
- AlphaOmegaSin
- BeatEmUps
- LarryBundyJr (Though if you're an Ashens fan, you might have seen this already)
- MetalJesusRocks
- PushingUpRoses
- PatTheNESPunk

---

7: MetalJesusRocks, *Game Sack* & SeeJayAre are some ones I really like

6: *Gaming historian* make some of the best videos on retro video games. It’s not really about collecting but gets really deep into the history of games.

5: Metal Jesus Rocks, RGT 85 (although he hasn’t really covered much of anything but the Switch for months which is annoying to me), Last Gamer, and Adam Koralik are my daily channels I check out. Once in a while I check out Radical Reggie and the Immortal John Hancock. I also quite enjoy *Gaming Historian* and Console Wars, but their content is spread out so far apart that I don’t really get to check them out a lot.

3: Cinemassacre but only the videos where they casually play games. Not the angry video game nerd stuff, I’ve never been into that for some reason.

4: Honestly, not many, at least not regularly. *My Life in Gaming* is probably the only fully-retro one I watch just about every episode from, but they largely inform me on potential new purchases for older consoles. Adam Koralik is great, as is anything EgoRaptor does, so I'll watch any of their titles that interest me. And I watched all of the Hidden Gems videos from MetalJesusRocks. But I find my YouTube game coverage to be a lot more orientated to channels that talk general about gaming in theory and/or personal experience, such as *Racyvick*, NakeyJakey, **Errant Signal**, and Innuendo Studios.

> 1: I found Nakey Jakey several months back and have enjoyed going through all his older videos and immediately watching his latest uploads as they come out. Great content!

3: Tightwhite and renebean are the ones I actively follow

3: Game Chasers, ThatZombieGuy, Metal Jesus, John Riggs, SeeJayAre, OKChief, and Drop Rate (Gotta give some love to my local Game store's Channel :)

1: I enjoy The Game Chasers.

1: happy console gamer (The YouTuber and I are from the same city), Seejayare (We both are Canadians), Nintendo collecting (Canadian and crazy Nintendo collection), Adam Koralik, metal Jesus rock, Pete dorr

## Bonus answers - best board game reviewers

138: I enjoy Shut Up & Sit Down. They're hilarious and while they give overviews of game play, their reviews are more experiential and don't get bogged down in reading the entire rule book.

I don't always share their exact taste in games, but their opinions are worth hearing. I found several of my favorite games from reviews of things Paul liked but didn't love enough to recommend.

> 43: I really appreciate that on top of being funny and infectiously enthusiastic about the hobby, SU&SD doesn't bog down their reviews with giving rules explainers. Getting enough of an idea of how the game plays is enough for me; I don't care about the minutiae at this point because if I'm watching a review, I haven't decided if I *actually care about the game.* So I really appreciate SU&SD's style of emphasizing the experiential elements of the game over explaining the individual rules.

> 19: ' their reviews are more experiential' - This, so much this. I will watch Dice Tower stuff if I want to know how something plays but if I want to know how it feels then SU&SD are amazing.

> 17: I like the SU&SD guys do a great job of making games feel *cool* to play. Boardgames are intrinsically linked to "nerd culture" and have a hard time shaking that image, but Quinns, Paul, and Matt are wonderful ambassadors for the hobby. Not only do they provide thoughtful, stylish, and challenging reviews for these games, they do it in

> 8: I have to go with SUSD.
>
> They are amazingly informative without deep diving on the rules, they explain interesting bits about the mechanics and do it in a skit show kind of way (at times).
>
> They show they really do care about gaming and how people experience the games themselves. They create a great culture of being good to fellow humans as well, of being inclusive.
>
> Also Matt's recipes are great. he really needs to do more.
>
> I really appreciate how they review games, how they always balance good and bad even with games they get giddy over.
>
> And some of their opinions of games (Matt's fallout review) are very critical but rightly so.
>
> I understand where my tastes differ from theirs, so i can usually judge from their opinions if I will or wont like the game.

73: I know The Dice Tower isn’t extremely popular here but to me Tom is the go to reviewer. He can quickly give me a feel of the game and give me a basic opinion. Plus pretty much every game has been reviewed by them

> 33: Why isn’t dice tower popular, did I miss something? Tom is a good reviewer.
>
> > 22: Yeah I'm confused. It's always been **SU&SD**, Dice Tower, and Rahdo as the big 3 from what I've seen.
> >
> > > 13: They’re extremely popular in the board game community in general. Reddit just doesn’t love him.
> > >
> > > > 9: Why is that? A sort of hipster complex?
> > > >
> > > > > 16: My five cents, they feel very much like quantity over quality to me. They still give solid critiques but they aren't very creative with it.
> > > > >
> > > > > > 12: Tom's pretty open about the quantity goal, he wants it to be that if your looking for a board game review, then the Dice Tower should have something.
> > > > >
> > > > > > 5: I agree with this. I watched a review the other day and he messed up a line but then kept on going and the entire thing felt rushed like he has to get to the next review. I don't love that but then again there is always a video on whatever I am looking for on The Dice Tower. My other complaint is their listicles which I would like if they were just lists, but they are hour-long videos of bad jokes and not seeing the actual game.
> > > >
> > > > > 8: My theory is yes, like most things that are popular, people think they're "overhyped" or "overrated". But it's not like anyone hypes them, they just have been around forever, give good reviews, and have enough people and time that they're able to review most games that come out.
> > > >
> > > > > 7: Tom can be a bit preachy and almost gruff when he gives his opinion, I think it’s rubs people the wrong way, even though I love him
> > > > >
> > > > > > 11: It's funny because I feel as though Tom lays his biasies out in the open and explains them while giving his judgement, which makes his reviews honest and trustworthy. He also makes the effort to note that his audience may not share his views and that's okay too.
> > > > >
> > > > > > 7: Preachy and gruff? I must have been watching a different person all these years, I certainly never got that feeling.

Quantity over quality is a good strategy for covering the "long tail" of obscure games, but makes them a poor place to read about popular or critically acclaimed games. If I'm looking for a review of a specific game, I can usually find a more interesting and better-produced review somewhere else, whether in video or in writing.
> > >
> > > Plus, reviewing fewer games can be a basic quality filter. Shut Up & Sit Down have made this an explicit policy, and I expect other sites do the same thing: if a game isn't good, they don't review it unless there's a specific reason. That way their site becomes a showcase of games that are either very good or good-with-issues. If a game's only been reviewed by the Dice Tower and a couple of obscure websites, it's safe to assume that it's not an amazing game.

47: So Very Wrong About Games is my favorite reviewer, closely followed by **Shut Up and Sit Down**. I like them for different reasons. **SUSD** is usually funny and sometimes insightful. Quinns, Matt and Paul all have great chemistry. They are the very best at generating excitement for a game, even when I know I don't have the group for it, I get to urge to buy whatever they're hyping. That is both a pro and a con. Their actual recommendations are hit and miss for me though. There are a variety of reasons for this.

But SWVAG is the very best at actually reviewing games. A clear eye on a game's systems and how they interact (really nailing what makes them tick or why they aren't working), looking at a game in the context of its genre, comments on the historical and cultural context as well as how it compares to similar games. I don't always agree with their recommendations, but I feel like I always know why they like or dislike something, which is what I need to inform my purchase.

Edit: which is apparently a controversial opinion, judging by the downvotes ...

36: JonGetsGames doesn’t review any more, but his style was always my favorite.

24: SU&SD always make me laugh. My girlfriend thought I was a freak for laughing so hard until they reviewed a game that she liked.

20: The GameNight! crew are my favorite. Explanation of the rules, then they play, then they critique. It took me a while to warm up to them, but I'd much rather watch people who are passionate about gaming interact with each other, than watch someone just talking to the camera. Dice Tower would be second, as I can't think of a better ambassador to gaming than Tom Vasel. His enthusiasm for ALL games, of all types, is second to none (even if he proclaims he doesn't like zombie games, yet likes every one that he's played). :P

19: My fiancé and I really love GameBoyGeek. We always learn how to play new games because he explains things very well.

19: Zee from the Dice Tower.
He is intelligent, sharp, has a solid camera presence, knows his stuff, and his reviews actually touch the game like a reviews should. I don't really share the taste in games for the most parts, but his reviews are really good.

16: I really enjoy reading the space biff reviews on BGG.

18: Without a doubt my favourite reviewers are Shut Up & Sit Down. Their reviews are so thoughtful and in-depth that I can watch them and accurately predict if I will like a game 95% of the time , even if I don't agree with their conclusion. On top of that, their reviews are genuinely entertaining - humour is subjective but watching every video I have multiple laugh out loud moments (not just "lol", my wife sometimes actually comes into the room to ask what I am laughing at).

Second is JonGetsGames. He recently decided to stop doing reviews and concentrate on playthroughs. I fully understand why he made this decision and support it going forward, but his reviews were some of the best I have encountered. They were very well structured, interesting and informative. Similarly to SU&SD, I could come away from one of his videos with a very good idea of the game and whether I would like it or not. I will continue to watch his channel because his playthroughs are still very informative, but if you are looking for reviews specifically then you may need to watch his older videos.

16: Just looking over what's already been posted... wanted to throw out another name.

Marco Arnaudo is awesome. I suspect he hasn't received as much attention as some other reviewers because he started as a wargame reviewer almost exclusively. Though that's where is passion lies, over the last few years he's taken his channel and opened it up to euro games and family games as well. Production level and approach is similar to Joel Eddy's *DriveThruGames* (another fantastic reviewer). Marco is essentially a one man show, using a single camera to cover the basics of how the game works (often in good detail), and discussing his opinions of it. I really enjoy his thoughtfulness. He doesn't just like or dislike an aspect of a game without giving you his reasons. That's important for me. I also seem to share his taste in a lot of games, and honestly, I think this is 50% of what draws anyone to any particular reviewer.

11: Inside the box !!! Sad that they aren’t as popular as the usual heavy hitters...

11: Calandale.

33: I enjoy watching **SUSD** the most but don't take their reviews to heart.

Tom Vasel still is my go to. Funny thing about that though is I feel like I have very little in common with the dice tower guys when they do their favorite (insert whatever) list.

> 7: Funny thing about that though is I feel like I have very little in common with the dice tower guys when they do their favorite (insert whatever) list.

> Same, but since they've reviewed so many games at this point (particularly Tom), it's easy to tell whether or not I'd like a game even if they give it a negative review, since I know their preferences so well at this point.

23: Rahdo is my personal go-to. His taste in games runs similar to mine in many ways and he gives enough explanation in his reviews that I can tell where I agree with him and where I differ.

> 4: He's only reviewing from the perspective of 2 players though which doesn't match my situation.

20: I like Zee Garcia. His taste align with mine most of the time.

19: Heavy Cardboard is my go to.

14: **SUSD** is the only one I really watch just for fun. Everything else just comes across as amateurish.

However, I often watch Dice Tower for their sheer number of reviews.

13: Drive Thru Reviews

10: I enjoy **SUSD** a lot (although my tastes tend to align with Paul more than Quinns), and the guys at the Perfect Information podcast (infoperfected.com).

I generally find myself being at odds with most of the Dice Tower crew's opinions.

> 1: Definitely a + 1 for the perfect information podcast, I play with those guys and they know whats what.

10: I like watching Rahdo mainly because of his personality and not necessarily for the 'reviews'.

If I want to get an impression of a game, I'll see if Dice Tower (but only videos with Tom/Zee/Sam) or Watch it Played has a video of it.

Besides that, I don't attach a lot of value to a reviewer's opinion. Games that have had great reviews have fallen flat with my group and games that have had bad reviews have been smash hits with my group. Unless there's something fundamentally wrong with the game (i.e. the game is completely broken) I don't really need the reviewers opinion. Show me how the game is played and I'll form my own opinion and see if it's worth asking the people in my group what they think.

I also really enjoy Tabletop but mainly because of the guest celebrities and the high production quality.

7: My main two are Dice Tower and Rahdo. Any time I'm considering a game, I check them for reviews, as they both show how the game plays well.

8: Rahdo, but for the runthrough aspect. It's nice to hear his final thoughts but I'm watching to gauge how I will respond to the game and I think he does the best job with that. Thinking out loud about what he can do is a wonderful way to give me a sense of the game because that's what **I** will be thinking about when I play the game. I play games because thinking is fun, and he shows me what type of thinking I'll be engaged in.

JonGetsGames - I *love* that he does Positive / Neutral / Negative points of the game. Not nearly enough "reviewers" do this. I also love his links in the video that let me jump to the part I want, or skip to the next part once I get his point. His critiques are well-formed and well-informed, from a board gamer perspective.

I'll watch **SU&SD** and Tabletop for entertainment but not for reviews. The folks at SU&SD seem like lovely chaps (crickets for Tabletop) but I rarely get a good sense of the game by the end of their video.

Finally, not what I'd call a reviewer, but How to Play videos are a credit to the community. Rodney does an amazing job and if I didn't prefer learning-by-reading, I'd use all his videos as my instruction manual.

(Personally, I can't watch Dice Tower. I find their audience engagement lackluster and we clearly differ on what kind of games we enjoy.)

7: Heavy Cardboard. I'll buy most games they do a run through for.

6: My current go-to is Joel Eddy.

I really like Marco Arnaudo too, as well as Zee Garcia. And the production values of Man vs Meeple are top-notch.

I don't consider Rahdo a reviewer, but I like to watch him, too.
