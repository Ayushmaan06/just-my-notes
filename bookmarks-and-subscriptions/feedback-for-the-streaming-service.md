Sorry, but I couldn't find many things from my watchlist. I didn't find good classic and modern films made by innovative directors, several TV shows and several seinen anime. I will try to briefly list what I have not found, hoping that it will help your service to become better.

Thank you for having Hitchcock, Roman Polansky and Kubrick, but there are other good movies made by them. Also, I want to see more movies made by these directors: Fritz Lang, Orson Welles, Sidney Lumet, Akira Kurosawa, Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergio Leone, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Dario Argento, Ridley Scott, Emir Kusturica, Paul Thomas Anderson, Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Nicolas Winding Refn, Darren Aronofsky, Wes Anderson, Greta Gerwig, Bong Joon Ho.

Thank you for having Breakfast Club but there are other good movies from 80s: WarGames, The Last Starfighter, The Karate Kid.

TV shows: 24, Too Old to Die Young by Refn, Twin Peaks by David Lynch.
