## All spheres

30: **Lindsey Ellis**, also known as the Nostalgia Chick. Makes videos on <u>movies</u>, directors, editing, and history of film.

20: [**Every Frame a Painting**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A): unfortunately no longer active but has great videos on <u>film and editing</u>.

[MrBtongue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAJaOTL1BoipG41OmfyA): the guy who got me to start watching video essays in the first place. Not the greatest presentation but really interesting ideas.

[kaptainkristian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPgdqQKpq4T4zeqmTelnFg): my favorite presentation/editing, speaks to me personally as a person who grew up with Toonami and Adult Swim in the late 90s and early 00s.

[CaspianReport](https://www.youtube.com/user/CaspianReport/videos?disable_polymer=1): modern geopolitics and some recent history. He opened my eyes on many interesting topics in international politics such as the Iran-Saudi proxy war.

[*Core-A Gaming*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg/videos?disable_polymer=1): very niche topic of videos essays about competitive <u>Fighting Game E-Sports</u>.

[Noah Caldwell-Gervais](https://www.youtube.com/user/broadcaststsatic/videos?disable_polymer=1): rough/basic presentation but he goes extremely in-depth into the <u>games</u> he talks about. I mean he goes out of his way to finish every game (harder than it sounds) before he makes a video on them so his opinions are very well informed and often interesting to listen to. He also tends to play every single game in a series to completion in order to evaluate a series as a whole, which is really cool to see how a whole game series evolves through all its iterations.

[****Redlettermedia****](https://www.youtube.com/user/RedLetterMedia/videos?disable_polymer=1): they're not even focused on video essays. Half in the Bag is a bi-weekly movie review series, and Best of the Worst is more like a goofy Mystery Science Theater type thing. But their Plinkett Reviews are internet famous at this point, and each one they put out has quality ideas and great criticism. Their Ghostbusters 2016 review really wowed me in how succinctly it dissected how and why it failed as a reboot.

> 5: I want to second Noah. [His travel video essays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-naJR_rhkUM) are downright magical to me. How he weaves videogame commentary while talking about his experiences on the road and the various writers that have influenced not just his journey but his view on life is amazing.
>
> 4: **Noah Caldwell-Gervais** thirded, and the seconding the wonderful **MrBtongue** (when he does get around to making his videos!).

[The Royal Ocean Film Society](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWq-qJSudqKrzquTVep9Jwg)

[Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1)

Not all Vox is good, but these are.

[Vox - Earworm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fyqfIwGjH2fYC5fFLfdwW4)

[Vox - Pop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5dOiUTzcsHU5ahmgcqjdIJx)

7: All of the people already posted, but I also thoroughly enjoy [Like Stories of Old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4etinsAy34)

4: Came here to second anything Vox does, second Nerdwriter, and to offer the channel [Trekspertise](https://youtu.be/Hziy8HcZAFE)

5: There are some fantastic suggestions already here, so I'd like to just add a few more that I like:

[Folding Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ) which is part vlog, part video essay, but the guy knows his stuff about films.

[Pop Culture Detective](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiwtz2tCEfS17N9A-WoSSw) produced some great work on masculinity, feminism depicted in pop movies and tv.

3: Lessons from the Screenplay - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw

One of the best, and most unique, in that the creator of the channel is hyper-focused on what the screenplay of a film tells you.

Folding Ideas - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ

Dan Olsen is one of the youtube greats, imo.

Contrapoints - https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints

Some folks might take issue with me saying ContraPoints is a video essayist, as she doesn't really analyze texts so much as movements, especially political movements. That being said, her style of video is much more visual and symbolic than a mere blog, and I think she qualifies because she uses textual evidence in her analysis.

## Film analysis



## Video game analysis

26: Ok, here we go!

I credit all of my continuing game design education and advancement to working on games, discussing game design with other intelligent game designers I know, and watching a bunch of different YouTube channels! Even a channel that isn't specifically about game design can be helpful just by being one of a few thoughtful voices talking about a topic that is design adjacent. Before we get to the lists, let me hit you with a few disclaimers.

- This is obviously not every channel out there. Don't just use my list and move on with your day. I peruse almost every "what is your favorite design / analysis channel" thread (like this one) and add more channels for me to review.
- I have not included channels that have not uploaded in several months, or their last several months of uploads were not game focused. There are several channels I am actually subscribed to that haven't posted in over a year because if they ever post again I would be happy to watch whatever they produce. If they are gone forever, being subscribed to them doesn't cost me anything.
- I have reviewed WAY more channels than this over the years and have rejected many. Some because they are hot garbage trash fires. Some because they don't do a good job of staying on topic or successfully arguing their points with evidence or other issues that I feel attack the core of analysis. Some because they just don't happen to be in a style I like. Finally, some because we disagree on game design and my flawed human nature caused me to categorize them in the first two rejection categories when the problem is actually me. If you know I have reviewed your channel in the past and don't see it here now, just assume it is because of the last two categories. It's me, not you.
- I have tried to keep smart, well thought out channels that I actively disagree with in the list and you should too. With lists this big it would be SUPER EASY to only subscribe to people you agree with and then almost guarantee you never grow out of your current bubble of thinking. Obviously I am human and I assume I unfairly hold channels I disagree with to a higher standard then ones that have a two hour video parroting my own opinions. Keep that in mind.
- Finally, sometimes I catch a channel with 1000, or 500 or even 50 subscribers who is just starting out and happens to not be very good. I can think of several examples on this list I rejected initially for reasons I still find valid, but the videos they produce today are great. If you reject a channel, it is a good idea to do a quick check-in a while later if one of their videos happens across your radar to see if they have improved.

------

**This is my current filtered list - roughly categorized and listed alphabetically.**

------

**Main Channels:** These are the channels that primarily focus on game analysis. Picked by me with some arbitrary cutoff before it becomes a "games history" channel or a "game review" channel or things like that.

------

**Analysis Adjacent:** These channels are outside of what I would traditionally consider game analysis proper. Often more review or retrospective or even a little let's play-ish. I like em and I still get enough value from them that I still subscribe, even if it is more for fun and enjoyment than education.

**To Be Reviewed:** These are in my "To Be Reviewed" bookmarks. A video from this channel probably caught my eye because I liked the topic or sometimes just the game, and I saved it to be reviewed later. These could totally suck or they could be super awesome, but it didn't seem fair to leave them off the list just because I have been too lazy to take the time to look them over.

> 3: **Joseph Anderson** is my favorite of the ones I recognize here. His videos aren't for everyone interested in this topic. They can be extremely long, but they're thorough, not redundant. I love this sort of content because more typical reviews give the impression there's much less to talk about these games than there actually is, so I like that attention can be drawn to elements of a game that are often glossed over.
>
> I want to say that **Super Bunnyhop** has begun to shift focus to videos about the gaming industry and away from the games themselves, which is still an area I can watch and appreciate.
>
> 0: Excellent list here, but I gotta question Raycevick. Is that one that falls under your fourth bullet point or do you actually enjoy the channel? My opinion is that it falls under, as you say, "hot garbage trash fires" but I'm open to hearing other opinions about the channel.
>
> > 4: What's wrong with *Raycevick*? Like, he has excellent production quality, great narration, and some very solid videos Some of his side series (i.e. not Years Later) can be a bit hit or miss, but I think they're all of generally high quality.
> >
> > > 1: Rayc has fantastic production quality, this extends to both the audio and the visual department, but I'm not too keen on his essays. To me, they hover too closely to the surface level and never really dive into anything interesting. He rarely gets into the nitty gritty about a game, mechanic, story, or system and explains what makes it great or bad or interesting or anything. It doesn't feel like analysis to me.
> > >
> > > > 1: That's not really explaining much to me. Besides, I do think he does go into a great bit of detail. Take his latest video on King Kong. He managed to convey how this movie title succeeded where others have failed and elaborate on its strength (atmosphere and immersive) and its weaknesses (lack of weapon variety).

3: Blobdole has a great list so I'll only add the ones that aren't on there. I'll note that not all of these make content currently and some don't exclusively do analysis but all of these channels are worth checking out.

Currently Active:

[Game Score Fanfare](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8P_raHQ4EoWTSH2GMESMQA) - Maybe the only channel dedicated to the analysis of music in video games

[Gamedenker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMXXBuIQvUD45EtfWqzU0FQ) - A Must Watch Channel, they took a hiatus but have teased that they'll be back soon

12: **EDIT**: I have added all this to the link here : https://github.com/SubSage/Youtube-reference-list Please feel free to contribute!

I have a txt file I try to update occasionally with a list of these kinds of channels. I'll paste it below! If you know of any channels to add, please do tell and I'll gladly update the list. I would love to eventually just put this up somewhere too, oh well, one day.

Hi reader! This is Sage's (subsage.github.io) Curated list of youtube channels that I like to show to people interested in learning more about game development/design. You might end up not liking every single channel on here, but you should perhaps make a good effort to try and view each channel. Each channel here has a unique view/perspective on vide games from development to design that can be very helpful to all trying to make their own game. I'll try to update this list time to time as well as order it in some fashion, right now it's rather unordered. If you'd like to add to the list, please just contact me and let me know of a channel that you think could do well to this list. Please enjoy!

Folding Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ Mostly focuses on design aspects of film, but I find that a good amount of what he speaks has some use in game design. He does play video games as well and can time to time help directly with game design.

TotalBiscuit : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1Ms_5qBTawC-k7PVjHXKQ Big name in gamedev for reviewing games.

**Mark Brown** : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw Documentary/analysis series on game design and development. Has amazing presentation skills and a good voice.

Ahoy : https://www.youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy Documentary style overview of history of games and mechanics within games.

*Raycevick* : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw Video essays on games.

Jim Sterling : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA A voice in game dev, somewhat more difficult to hear out time to time. Has opinions sometimes worth hearing on news within the field. I'd give him a pass if you're hard pressed for time.

Noah Caldwell-Gervais : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CYeHPLer3lbEhgonvbbAA Long form analysis (video essays) on games. Very, and I mean extremely comprehensive analysis/discussion on video games. A short video here is easily 45min+.

Stop skeletons from fighting : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Xeb9-FhZXgvw340n7PsCQ Can't really think of much for this channel, haven't seen a whole lot, but seems somewhat promising. Good source for seeing other games in the field.

**Errant Signal :** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4JnxTxtvItQecKUc4zRhQ Well worded video essays on games

Game soup : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPMrF9AN_D9BrmSmMeV3hA Analysis of video games

**Super Bunnyhop :** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw Well worded criticisms and reviews of games in general.

snowman Gaming : https://www.youtube.com/user/snomangaming Video essays on game design

Extra Credits : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg This channel I do not recommend for anyone already invested, experienced, or familiar with game developemnt. This channel is more catering to an audience who has no backing in game development, in the more recent work, material has been authoriative to the point that several people from gamedev communities (yours truly & Gamedev reddit comments) have questioned EC's credibility as a voice.

Game References : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTxB1BeJYiNmuI1Nl2Tomgw This channel show cases menus from various games. It's rather uknown. Great channel for referencing other games' UI decisions. It's only showcase, no explanations will be found here.

*GDC* : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ Game development conference. This is THE conference for game developers to meet/showcase/showoff their works and projects. This channel will post a fraction of their conference videos on their youtube channel. You will find a plethora of post mortems, discussions, big name QA, workshops, etc. You can sign up on GDC's site to get access too all of their material. Watch this if you're at all serious about learning more of the scene of gamedev.

Handmade hero : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTznQhurW5AaiYPbhEA-KA A well known veteran of game development is creating a game from scratch and showing you every single line of code as well as explaining everything as he goes. He's making everything from scratch. All the code from the low level interaction to making the CPU interact with the GPU to the high level concepts/implementations of game mechanics.

Career Coach : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DWn7tAAtT0SVQRqlJRknQ Very friendly and motivation coach for people interested in game development. Has good advice all around.

Rock Lee Smile : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgy-XzXwcdJKNKIUyzQmw7Q Reviews games, has reviewed a large array of indie games. Good source for seeing other games in the field.

Writing on Games : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPlWv88ZRMxCcK3BGjrX7ew A channel that does in depth analysis of video games for mechanics he finds interesting. Provides good insight on several topics.

> 5: Jim Sterling is a terrible choice for this list.
>
> Most of the time, he reviews games without even paying attention to controls or game options, then spends whole video complaining about all that in-game, blaming developers. Same thing goes for basic gameplay elements.
>
> Basically, he doesn't pay attention to what's even going on in the game while reviewing them. Compare that to TB who actually spends (too much) time just talking about controls and video options at the start of his videos in every game.
>
> 2: I very much recommend [**Super Bunnyhop**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw) aka George who is a really smart dude and his videos are very well researched and entertaining. (Yes I have a bit of a man-crush on him)

2: Film critique has had more time and respect to develop its theory, and I feel that video game studies are struggling to catch up. Nevertheless, I do think Noah Caldwell-Gervais and **Errant Signal** are sufficient, though we should always strive for more.

3: I've been only to find a few so far:

[**Game makers toolkit** is exactly what you're looking for](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337)

[Also there's **Errant signal**, which is very similar](https://www.youtube.com/user/Campster)

[And my favorite is **Noclip**. Which isn't what youre describing, but it has very interesting documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw)

Doesn't talk about game design at all, is just an obsessed voice for the white male babies who are increasingly threatened by diversity and greater representation in gaming(and society in general, most likely).

> He's one of the few game reviewers who very thoroughly play games in their entirety before reviewing. He doesn't chase the newest trendiest game to push out a half-baked review and then move on to the next. He simply plays a game to completion, often an entire series of games to completion, and therefore gives you a very detailed and encompassing review of them.

50: [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) for industry veterans talking about game design and related issues.

[**Errant Signal**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4JnxTxtvItQecKUc4zRhQ) for in depth analysis of themes and the like.

[**Super Bunnyhop**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqr2tH3dPshNhPjV5h1xRw) for in-depth, knowledgable user reviews.

> 19: I love **Superbunnyhop** and **Errant Signal**, but for people who don't know of them Extra Credits is really hit or miss for me. As far as I know, their resident expert James works heavily in mobile gaming so a lot of their perspective from inside the industry comes from that direction.
>
> Moreover, sometimes they make videos outside of their element that are really poorly researched and end up being misleading or just incorrect.

49: Also, GDC (the game developers conference) has a bunch of lectures free on YouTube on all kinds of topics. It’s not the sultry tones of Mark Brown, but I’m addicted to them.

> 20: IMO these are the real meat. Very informative and straight from the source.
>
> 4: I'm not even a music guy, but [Mick Gordon's talk on Doom's music](https://youtu.be/U4FNBMZsqrY) was very good

36: Nakey Jakey is my personal favorite, He blends in-depth analysis with comedy and he reflects on how video games affected his life ranging from really good times to really dark times and he's super creative and talented when it comes to his music and videos.

He also makes videos on topics that I don't really see anyone else making videos on such as save points in video games, video game box art, clothing in videos games, beer in video games, the art of video game commercials, the beauty of watching games and much much more.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSdma21fnJzgmPodhC9SJ3g

> 11: +1 Nakey Jakey. Everyone I've shown him too has gotten hooked. He has a great authorial voice; genuinely funny and occasionally heartbreakingly earnest.

26: *Core-A Gaming* is a fantastic resource for Fighing Game Philosophy / the FGC. While very specific, it's a near one-of-a-kind channel; very few people cover the FGC and fighting games in this regard, and most not nearly as well.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7njg__VOy3n-SvXemDHvg

27: Super **bunnyhop**: video essays with a game journalism vibe on niche or specific topics

Gdc (game developer conforence) : presentations

Dark pixel : good, in depth reviews of jrpgs - makes discussion videos to participate in, also a podcast

Just a few off the top of my head

18: I really came around on the music in BotW after watching 8-Bit Music Theory's series on it. He digs into how the sparse and minimalistic music serves the game as a whole and its fascinating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl-6K3zrcr0

He covers a lot of what makes video game music so great, and is one of my favorite channel

16: EXTRA CREDITS. Compared to GMT, production quality is lower, but the specificity of topics in “ExtraCredits” is fantastic. And a lot of the time they talk about how game design principles can be applied elsewhere.

To get started, maybe check out the series on Incentive Systems in Politics, or the one on Balancing MMO Populations based on Bartle’s Taxonomy (you should find them by googling, but I’m on mobile and I’ll link later). Or just scroll through their gigantic list of topics and click the first one that gets your interest.

There’s at least 150 episodes and if you want more, check out ExtraFrames, which specifically discusses animation in games. They also do ExtraHistory and ExtraSciFi too.

> 22: I *REALLY* fell off with extra credits. "Myth of the Gun" is one of their best episodes. Nowadays though it feels like they're coasting on their laurels.

16: I really enjoy watching videos that discuss video games, so I put this list together ranking my favorite channels. I gave scores given to these youtube channels based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: The critic’s usage of varied diction, syntax, sentence structure, pacing when speaking, thought organization, how smoothly a video flows from point to point, and mastery over tone, volume, and speed. Channels were also scored based on their insight into the subject matter they discussed in videos. Essentially, if a critic only produced a cursory examination of a subject, they received a lower score. Conversely, if a critic produced new and thought provoking ideas about the subject they were discussing, they received a higher score.

**FAQ**

- Why didn't *youtube channel here* make the list?

If the channel was primarily focused on gaming news, comedy with video games, a single video game/game franchise, education/tutorial videos, or let's play videos, it did not make the list. This list is primarily for youtube channels focused on video game critique, reviews, and discussion.

- Why didn't *youtube channel here* make the list even though it fits the criteria?

I probably haven't heard of the channel. Youtube is a vast ocean of videos, and small channels are notoriously hard to find. Send me a message if you think you have a youtube channel that should be included on the list.

If you are unhappy in any way about this list, please know that I just made it for fun. This is all my subjective opinion and is in no way a universal standard. If you find a channel you love through this post, even if it was rated poorly, then I couldn't be happier. I just want to share channels I like with others.

- [**Joseph Anderson**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ) Long video critique essays.

  > I second Joseph Anderson, he puts out long, scripted, heavily edited videos. They usually contain spoilers (he walks through the entire story and analyses it), but always opens with a short (5-15 minutes) spoiler free recommendation. Don't expect to see a lot of games from him, he takes his time (5 months between his last (God of War) video and the one before it).

  > I really like [The Gaming Brit](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGamingBritShow). He uploads very rarely, but I love his videos. He don't post only reviews or analysis, but sometimes how a game sucks and why, giving a lot of arguments. His master piece is [the 30 minutes video about Other M](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX4mhp-8sOc) (and another [15 minutes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfS0254dRRw) with rebuttal of some comments).

> 3: You should definitely check out [*Raycevick*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw/featured?disable_polymer=1). He's most known for his "X Years Later" series. I would put his in the 9/10 or maybe even 10/10 category.

8: I like **Mark Brown**'s videos but every time I see him stream he completely sucks at any game he plays and misses important parts of the game, so he is a confusing person to me.

7: I would add these to the list, even if they are rather newbies to this topic

[Adam Millard - The Architect of Games](https://www.youtube.com/user/Thefearalcarrot/videos)

[Leonardo Da Sidci](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCujjLOPLW92zVBlhaL8wxPg/videos)

Edit: I'd add another one, tho its more like a documentary with the developers about their games

[**Noclip**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw/videos)

---

> Reviewers on youtube similar to Jim, Totalbiscut, Yahtzee, And Angry Joe?

37: Idiotech and **Super Bunnyhop** are pretty good.

> 7: Super Bunnyhop had more of an in-depth and analysis-like style, moist similar to TB (but mute analytical) from OP's list.

23: Dont quite know if it fits your bill, but from a shere point of quality i'd recommend [MatthewMatosis](https://www.youtube.com/user/Matthewmatosis), or [Joseph Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ), both does extremely in-depth reviews or analysis

> 17: I second Joseph Anderson, he puts out long, scripted, heavily edited videos. They usually contain spoilers (he walks through the entire story and analyses it), but always opens with a short (5-15 minutes) spoiler free recommendation. Don't expect to see a lot of games from him, he takes his time (5 months between his last (God of War) video and the one before it).

17: Karak from **ACG**, does nice in-depth reviews.

> 19: That aren't 2 minutes long or filled with sponsored bull crap.
>
> > My comment: is this a joke about IGN? :)

9: **Super Bunnyhop** is probably my favourite one (besides TB of course)

7: I discovered YongYea about a month ago. So far he's been great for news and general punditry.

5: SidAlpha's quite a good pundit if you like the industry commentatry.

> 11: Sid's gone a little sideways lately. I haven't seen a review pop up from him in ages and he's just turned into a drama channel that's started to show off that he's nothing like TB

7: WorthABuy has a very cynical elitist PC gamer attitude you might like

5: youtube channel "Worth A Buy" is pretty good

4: Karak from **ACG** is great, as is SkillUp. **SuperBunnyhop** has already been mentioned, so I'll throw in Idiotech and Luetin09. And of course, we couldn't skip SidAlpha.

Hope this helps!

4: Gotta shout out my boy SkillUp! He does long-form reviews that are quite awesome and not something I typically see in game reviews.

5: Mack @ https://www.youtube.com/user/Worthabuyguys

> 6: I really like his reviews but I really hate his edgy social commentary.

2: Not gaming, but Gigguk does anime videos and was inspired by Yahtzee which can be easily seen in his work

2: Not quite like what you've mentioned but *Easy Allies* is an excellent place for reviews and discussions about games.

They're the former Gametrailers crew.

2: Reiterating, **ACG** is pretty great. Has an incredibly fun way with words, though he doesn't do skits or anything like Angry Joe.

Boomstick (the guy who had his Dead Cells review plagiarized) seems pretty decent. His delivery is... a bit dull but the critique is interesting enough. Videos may be brief for some people's tastes, but he manages to cover a lot of ground despite that. *Raycevick* is more analytical and recent retrospective, but could be up your alley. Gggmanlives seems pretty okay from what I've watched so far. SplatterCatGaming (I think I got turned to him, *Raycevick*, and Gggman on this sub so basically just echoing others on these recommendations) does first impressions of indy and mid-shelf games. Less reviews, more of a let's play format with jokey commentary. Even if you aren't into his format (and I don't blame you), I'd suggest subbing regardless if you dig obscure indie games like the ones TB covered regularly since SCG does that sort of thing almost exclusively.

Lazy Game Reviewer might strike your fancy, he does that part critique/part comedy thing that Joe does--albeit with mostly retro games, old/strange hardware, and recent sim games/their expansions. Also, the skits have been pretty cut down more recently. Aside from reviews, his Tech Tales series is basically a bunch of mini-documentaries and they are fascinating (the only gaming doc YouTubers I think do better jobs are Noclip and, of course, Ahoy). He doesn't do them *too* often, but they have nice production values which make it worth the wait (imo, at least) and there's a sizeable backlog to dive into for newcomers.

>  Who is your most trusted source of game reviews?

54: *Easy Allies*

> 4: It’s because of them I bought Yakuza 0 having never heard of the series before - one of the best purchases of 2017 for me.
>
> 2: Agreed. Their Frametrap podcast is also great, it's just a ridiculously long discussion about the games they are playing and what they think about them. They'll cover a lot of games that might not get a regular review.

35: **ACG** - youtube - very neutral, always explaines why he likes or dislikes specific things and even if you dont agree with him, he makes sure you know how he got to his conclusion.

skillup - youtube - i dont agree with everything, however i am always sure he played the games he reviews ( you can watch him play the games on twitch somethimes). and like **ACG** he explaines how he comes to his conclusion.

both of these are also familyfriendly in language, if that is of concern

*easy allies* - youtube - their reviews are shorter then the named above, so i would choose them for something really quick, where i just want to know what the game has to offer.

also i watch Jim Sterling. i almost never agree with his opinions (with some exeptions) , however i find him funny and he is usually very honest about his opinions. though definitly NOT family friendly language lol

16: Streams of actual, non-industry people playing the game I want to know about. Even if you don't have the time to watch all the stream, you can get a feel for the title and, if the chat is slow enough, ask questions about the specifics you care about to the person playing.

You can't really hide things in uninterrupted gameplay and random low-tier streamers don't have much to lose by dunking on a game.

Sure you can't get pre-release information about a game from a random stream (they usually only let press get that kind of access) but who the heck buys games near release anyway? Wait a while for the suckers who bought it to work out all the bugs and swoop in after some patch cycles for a better experience.

12: None. I usually read multiple reviews from a lot of different sources. Things they have in common are probably correct.

7: I follow The Angry Joe Show on YouTube (with Joe Vargas) because I feel like his taste in games aligns pretty closely with mine, other than his whole anti-zombie game thing. Plus I just think him and Other Joe are hilarious. And he also tends to review movies I'm interested in too, and covers gaming industry news.

His videos are longer than five minutes, but he tends to give a critical overview in the first few minutes, then elaborates on how he came to that conclusion in the rest of the video.

I also really like Zero Punctuation for quick but I wouldn't call Yahtzee a non-biased reviewer, he definitely has obvious preferences that color his opinions about games.

> 9: i agree but i wish he would just calm down a little.
>
> then again its kind of his schtick so i cant really complain too badly.

7: Gameranx, they dont give scores and just state the “facts” and talk aboutvthe game which i like

> Second this, "Before you Buy" is my go to for any games I'm on the fence about

5: I enjoy **ACG**. Not 5 minute long but much more in depth, structured reviews without any spoilers. Check him out on YouTube.

3: **ACG** is really comprehensive

5: I'm a fan of Gameranx. And *Easy Allies* is good too.

3: Destructoid is fairly accurate. I’ve followed them for years.

2: **ACG** if I can spare the time. Easy Allies otherwise.

44: I personally love Skill Up. Australian reviewer that mainly focuses on looter-shooters and single player campaigns, super thorough. He also has a "Don't Miss This" series where he highlights easily overlooked games. He talks a lot about how the game feels, it's less a focused category-by-category breakdown of the game. Highly recommend.

> 5: MMMMMM looter shooters, one of my fav genres. I will def be giving this a look. Im a total whore for anything loot driven. I will grind games like Diablo or Borderlands for 1,000s of hours.

32: The best one I can think of is Accursed Farms. One of the series on that channel is "Ross's game dungeon," where he mostly reviews old or forgotten games.

> 21: Just be warned that a lot of what Ross reviews on the Game Dungeon is well within the "I played this so you don't have to" category.
>
> 10: Came to say this. Excellent channel, someone recommended it to me a couple of months ago and I've already seen all game dungeon videos. I've heard his Freeman's mind videos are great too.

25: *Mandaloe Gaming*, *Ragnarrox*, Ssethtzeentach, Noah Caldwell Gervais, **Mark Brown**, and the website Rock Paper Shotgun.

> 20: Ssethtzeentach
>
> Whether you agree with his humour or not, Sseth has recommended/reviewed a lot of really good games, old or new(ish), and I found my current favourite, Starsector, through him.
>
> > 9: Hard agree. His humor can be extremely edgy and abrasive, but he regularily recommends games that I end up loving. Instead of giving a general overview or summarising the different aspects (story, gameplay, graphics etc.), he focuses on the strange details and peculiarities that make those games unique and worth playing. He really highlights the games' strenghts and has a different approach for each one. I really like this style and he convinced me to check out quite a few games so far.
> >
> > 12: I'd call him the 4Chan version of Mandalore.
>
> 17: Noah Caldwell Gervais
>
> seconded.

23: **Errant Signal** is one of my favorite channels. While they will occasionally look at mainstream games, most are weird indie games and theres one episode of them just trying out random steam games.

> 4: Errant signal is my favorite. He's great at picking apart game systems and not just showing how they work, but what they say about the games subject. He's really the first person who got me to think seriously about games as an artistic medium in concrete terms.

15: I have some great ones you'll want to check out:

- [LGR](https://www.youtube.com/user/phreakindee) - A legend in the retro gaming community. Has a broader focus than the others, and does videos ranging from games, hardware, books, and other things.
- [Gaming Historian](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcfrosticles) - Another legend. Does lots of in-depth videos on gaming hardware and games.
- [Ahoy](https://www.youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy) - Pretty much the same as the above. Fantastic channel.
- [Jeremy Parish](https://www.youtube.com/user/toastyfrog) - Very underrated. Does in-depth, game-by-game explorations videos of the Gameboy, NES, and SNES catelogs.
- [My life in Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeingaming) - A great up and coming retro gaming channel. Does videos on hardware, getting the best picture from retro games, retrospectives, and more.
- [Daniel Ibbertson](https://www.youtube.com/user/djslopesroom) - Another great retro channel channel. Very 90s focused.
- [Kim Justice](https://www.youtube.com/user/elmyrdehory) - Pretty decent, has some good videos.
- [Jimmy Hapa - Import Gaming FTW](https://www.youtube.com/user/jimmyhapa) - Focused on games from the 90s that never left Japan.

15: Suspecting from relooking at rules this MAY be off topic since its asking for reccomendations...but not on games. Again my apologies if this is indeed off topic. I know though I will get MUCH better and more serious answers here then any general gaming reddit/forum though. People here understand and see games in a different way

> 5: **ACG** Reviews. Very thorough game reviews.
>
> 8: **Mandalore**
>
> Sseth is also similar, less in-depth but with more humor.
>
> He reviews games so niche his videos already DDOS'd servers of two games.

9: Mm. These may be *too* deep of cuts but you might check out Stop Skeletons from Fighting. They like to look at 1) Spooky games and 2) Old games that were perhaps overly ambitions for their time.

You may not find a whole ton of stuff you're going to run out and grab but knowing there was a playable prototype of Resident Evil 1 on the Gameboy Color was certainly entertaining in and of itself.

I *was* totally introduced to the D series, Illbleed, Wild Guns, and the Doom playstation edition (with new music and spooky lighting!) through them for what it was worth and I did wind up getting my hands on those so there may be something there for ya though a lot of it is gonna be older.

9: He can be a bit dry and has a very particular taste, but **Matthewmatosis** might be what you're looking for. He has a background in software development, and in my opinion has more interesting insights than the likes of **Game Maker's Toolkit** or *GamingBrit*. While his most popular videos have to do with well-known games like Dark Souls, he has a lot of videos on more obscure stuff like Rain World, Spacechem and the Wonderful 101.

7: LGR

6: A few of my go-to video game channels (All reviews/retrospectives)

[**Mandalore Gaming**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOGLGPOqlAiLmOvXW5lKbw) - pretty well known now, has a tendency to play odd Russian Games but goes in depth about everything he plays. In many ways his videos are an adequate replacement for actually playing some of these older or just clunkier titles.

[B-Mask](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbBxFs86hk6IMd16YlfXPg) - Wonderful YouTuber with *the* defining videos on the Sly Cooper games which is a must watch for any fans of that series. Brilliantly in depth with a focus on stories and visual storytelling from a theatre background.

[Pepp's Indie Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkCPjKpngDHZp0orr7GuGA) - The actual videos aren't the best due to the frequency this guy puts out videos, but the actual review in the narration is still fine - worth following just to see a new game every otther day and just watch the ones when you're interested

[Alpha Beta Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKNiazqmuUi9CeX_kyDpjw) - the YT channel of a website which plays and documents early stage indie video games. Brings out a 20-30min no-commentary gameplay video sometimes multiple times a day - again, worth following and clicking on the ocassional video if it looks good.

[Table 53](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimJO6nZt-Yanp2j8Kd9g0Q?view_as=subscriber) - (actually me) focus on quality, niche indie games. If a game isn't good or worth playing I tend not to write about it. Occasionally produces longer, detailed retrospective style content on bigger games (Sunset Overdrive, Ico in the next week or so)

------

[LesserMan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2a_P0QAZkdqGvOPDbpwfQ) - Plays a lot of 'old school' PS2 classics with a long form 'review' style that covers the entire game's story with frequent (sometimes too frequent) jokes and animations. If it's your thing you will absolutely love it so definitely worth watching a few minutes just in case.

[Shut Up & Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRhIGDUKdIOw07Pd8pHxCw) - The best channel on YouTube produces wonderful videos about board games with incredible production quality both in a writing and technical sense, they support a full five man company purely from donations, and also host a site with frequent well written reviews about board gaming, and an excellent monthly podcast. So if you love board gaming you have to give them a watch.

[Eurothug4000](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxddeIv7GdHNcVPZI9JvGXQ) - The channel is nothing like the name. A woman who is far too obsessed with the upcmoing Death Stranding, but has made some incredibly insightful videos looking into the trailers and coming up with theories about possible gameplay and lore. Also writes detailed reviews of games including Dino Crisis and Animal Crossing: Wild World

[Quest Marker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH6gsbnwEM76Jn-HrBI6Syg) - A very small channel with some wonderful, calm videos about small indie games. Posts a video about every month so no spam in the subscription feed and talks about games worth hearing about.

17: ACG is my main reviewer I go to

> 13: ACG is consistent, but mostly shallow. Kinda the thing you'll get if you skim the pros/cons at the end of an article, but 15 mins long
>
> > 4: And not full of sponsored bull crap
>
> 2: He doesn't really take advantage of the medium in my opinion. He's too safe in his assessments as to avoid angering or offending anyone. Just comes across as a fake radio host to me.

11: I always enjoy *Easyallies* reviews of games. Generally impartial and go to a reasonable depth. I haven't had any bad recommendations from them yet.

> 5: Just an FYI, the *EasyAllies* crew are all former [Gametrailers.com](https://gametrailers.com/) producers and writers. So if you liked [Gametrailers.com](https://gametrailers.com/) and their videos, definitely give their channel a go.

7: I’m a big fan of Worth a Buy. Beware though, he will tear your game a new one if it’s shit.

6: *Racavick* or however u spell it and skillup

Edit: *Raycevick*

> 2: I like skillup but as much as he says hes not a fanboi, he totally is a fanboi.
>
> Also Upvote for *Racavick*! Guy is great. :) (Also love his Celldweller plug every chance he gets!) :)
>
> > 2: Skill up kinda annoying butttt he really put out for warframe my fave game of all time (close to 3k hours) so i like tolerate him lol
> >
> > > 1: Yes. It was funny how he was “done with destiny” and yet clenched to that like no tomorrow.
> > >
> > > I applaud warframe and DE, im a casual so i dabble in it from time to time, mates are heavy into it.. like 5th or 6th play through on a stock account. So i get why people tolerate him. I like him cause he’s aussie, and its fun to give him shit (aussies are great shit talkers)

5: [GrimBeard](https://www.youtube.com/user/GrimbeardDiaries/videos) goes into great depth. His humour is also very self-aware and sometimes quite dark. 5k subs and is criminally under rated.

[2kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/user/2kliksphilip/videos), well spoken and does alot of nostalgic reviews. 383k subs, (he has several channels).

[**SuperBunnyHop**](https://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow/videos) is another YouTuber that goes into great depth. He has a series called *Games in my Inbox*. 373k subs.

[**MandaloreGaming**](https://www.youtube.com/user/MandaloreGaming/videos). Even though he doesn't upload videos often, [he made a video segment showcasing smaller YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT2mEO0JtOo), some of which are on my list. 153k subs.

[Voxis Productions] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVm16YNvy3AaEG7T8bcPGtQ). The host of the review is a classy and hilarious puppet, which is a unique feature that you don't see on YouTube very often. 31k subs.

> 2: +1 for grimbeard, underrated.

3: I like Caddicarus a lot. He's thorough in his explanations and very entertaining. He does talk about spoilers somewhat often but he always tells you it's coming so you can skip ahead or not watch the video.

3: I have a couple. Most reviewers, especially smaller ones tend to specialize in a certain style of game or era.

Channels that review indie and retro inspired new games. Kimchika (maybe the best person I’ll mention as they stream new games a ton while discussing them). Critique Quest (maybe the best review channel on YouTube)

Retro based but review new retro inspired games. St1ka (a small channel that’s picking up pace quick, he’s a review channel only with a weekly stream.)

I have a couple more, but they are mostly retro only but include new games for retro systems so I’ll leave them off the list.

3: I like to watch a mix of people like videogamedunkey, Caddicarus and Yahtzee from zero punctuation.

Though I find that my main source and who I trust the most is Gameranx. I just like their attitude I guess. They structure their reviews in a very talkative way, as if they're discussing it with the viewer personally. I like how they seem to emphasize how a game "feels" as well. Definitely worth a look into.

---

2: If you want a group, definitely *Easy Allies* (staffed my former GameTrailers veterans, including the original co-owner/video narrator). For single person, my favourite is SomeCallMeJohnny. He’s a chill dude who loves games, especially Sonic and Metroid.

> 2: My man!!!!!!!!!! He’s also extremely funny on his Twitch and LP channel.

2: **Acg**

2: Dunkey, hands down
